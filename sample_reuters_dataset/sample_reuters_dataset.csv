110,""" We need to find new business chances ,"" Komatsu said ."
111,""" In some cases these will be securities related , in some cases trust bank related ."
112,"That ' s the kind of deregulation we want ."""
113,"Until such changes occur , Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd , in which it holds a five pct share , Komatsu said ."
114,"He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary , Banca del Gottardo ."
115,"The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U . S . Commercial banks soon , following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct ."
116,But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary .
117,""" We don ' t want to make waves ."
118,"We expect this will be allowed in two or three years ,"" he said ."
119,"Like other city banks , Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business , he added ."
120,"The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives , including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo ."
121,""" It ' s ( Sumitomo ) been bold in its strategies ,"" said Kleinwort ' s Smithson ."
122,""" After that , it ' s a question of absorbing and juggling around ."

134,"The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12 . 2 billion marks , below the outgoing 14 . 9 billion , banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity ."
135,"Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market , as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement , its main open - market instrument for steering market interest rates ."

268,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets , analysts said ."
269,"High short - term interest rates , a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months , largely from Japanese and U . S . Investors , analysts polled by Reuters said ."
270,"Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia , Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U . S . Dollar instruments , they said ."
271,"A one percentage point fall in key 10 - year bonds rates in the past month , record share prices and a 10 - month high for the currency of 0 . 71 U . S . Dlrs all illustrated the inflow ."
272,"Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available , but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States ."
273,""" These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don ' t know what to do with it ."
274,"Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability ,"" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said ."
275,""" There is a ' flight to quality ',"" Hamley said ."
276,""" Australia may not be in the best ( economic ) position , but there aren ' t too many other countries where you ' d want to put your money ."""
277,"The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U . S . Unit , analysts said ."
278,""" We ' re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U . S . Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U . S . Dollar ,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said ."
279,""" Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable ?"""
280,"But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy , he said ."
281,""" It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy ,"" Buttrose said , adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government ' s promised tough economic statement on May 14 ."
282,"While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere , fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese , who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates , analysts said ."
283,""" It will remain very edgy money ."
284,"If something was not to be delivered , if the statement wasn ' t considered tough enough , one might see a substantial outflow ,"" Buttrose said ."
285,"Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit , analysts said ."
286,""" They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here ,"" Buttrose said ."
287,Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations .
288,"Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their "" eyes off the yen "" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors ."
289,Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen .
290,"Apart from its recovery against a weak U . S . Dollar , the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade - weighted basis in the last three weeks ."
291,Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market .
292,"It has followed Wall Street and other markets , but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities , particularly in the gold sector ."
293,"The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1 , 758 . 3 today , nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986 , while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3 , 081 . 0 in the same period ."
294,"The property sector is also sought after , with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate , particularly in the tourism field ."
295,Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney ' s five - star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought .
296,""" They think they find good value real estate here which , with long term and fixed capital investment , is the kind of investment Australia needs ,"" Buttrose added ."
297,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY Kuwait ' s oil - reliant and debt - ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery , bankers and economists say ."
298,Crucial will be the ability of the 13 - member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens .
299,"Bankers estimate the economy , measured in terms of gross domestic product ( gdp ), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8 . 1 pct the year before ."
300,"This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1 . 5 pct in 1985 , slowing to 1 . 0 pct in 1986 ."
301,"Factors depressing economic activity include the 6 - 1 / 2 - year - old Iran - Iraq war on Kuwait ' s doorstep , which threatens the emirate ' s vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence ."
302,"But sentiment received a much - needed boost in September when , after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market , a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced ."
303,"The share crash , result of a speculative spree in forward trading , left 95 billion dlrs of post - dated cheques in default ."
304,"The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending , thus generating an informal credit system ."
305,Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies .
306,"There was some 4 . 4 billion dinars ( about 15 . 7 billion dlrs ) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986 , of which one - quarter to one - third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt ."
307,But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under .
308,"The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years , depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not ."
309,Banks ' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1 . 7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil .
310,"Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut , bankers and economists say ."
311,"Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) compared with production capacity of 4 . 0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al - Khalifa al - Sabah ."
312,But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one - half of its output as high - grade refined oil products .
313,"Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2 . 00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil , kerosene and naphtha , rather than as crude ."
314,Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism .
315,"Other reasons are low domestic inflation , a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady ."
316,"External accounts are in good shape , with an estimated 1 . 8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986 , 16 pct below that for 1985 , but still an achievement in the recession - hit Gulf ."
317,"Kuwait ' s petrodollar reserves in mid - 1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs , earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3 . 65 billion dlrs a year ."
318,"But for the first time since the end of the oil boom , these reserves may not be enough to prevent a "" real "" budget deficit for the 1986 / 87 fiscal year ending June 30 , bankers say ."
319,"In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary , revenues for 1986 / 87 were cut 38 . 6 pct and spending 11 pct , doubling the nominal deficit to 1 . 33 billion dinars ."
320,"This left out income from state reserves , usually excluded in official budget accounting , which are forecast by bankers at up to 1 . 0 billion dinars in 1986 / 87 , resulting in some shortfall ."
321,Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next .
322,""" It depends on oil prices ,"" one said ."
323,""" This summer is important ."""
324,Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al - Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy .
325,"He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987 / 88 budget , possibly in June ."
326,"MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987 , oil palm growers told Reuters ."
327,"Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4 . 5 mln tonnes , unchanged from 1986 , because of drought , low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms , they said ."
328,The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia ' s oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year .
329,"Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne , or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil , but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry , a leading grower told Reuters ."
330,"The country ' s palm oil stocks now total some 500 , 000 tonnes against about 800 , 000 last March , the growers said ."
331,The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U . S .

336,"They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow , with some 50 , 000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100 , 000 in 1986 , although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years ."

388,"SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS A bid by San Miguel Corp ( SMC ) & lt ; SANM . MN > to buy back 38 . 1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank ( UCPB ) has been hit by two new lawsuits , sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said ."
389,"A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares , which represent 31 pct of SMC ' s outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares , until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco , a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB ."
390,Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund ( CIIF ) and 1 . 4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares .
391,Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment .
392,"His petition said UCPB ' s plans to sell the shares to SMC were "" a serious breach of fiduciary duties ."""
393,"The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) by Eduardo de los Angeles , a government nominee on the company ' s board ."
394,"De los Angeles , who represents SMC ' s minority stockholders , asked the SEC to block the transaction , approved last week by the company ' s board ."
395,On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4 . 79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share .
396,De los Angeles told the SEC the company ' s retained earnings of 1 . 33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends .
397,De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2 . 2 - to - 1 debt to equity ratio .
398,He quoted SMC ' s chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2 . 5 - to - 1 .
399,"In petitioning the SEC , de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties ."
400,De los Angeles ' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26 . 5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC ' s Hong Kong subsidiary & lt ; Neptunia Corp > for a down payment on the shares .
401,The loan assumption was again ratified by last week ' s board meeting .
402,An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15 .
403,""" The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements , in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives , to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares ,"" San Miguel Corp said in a statement ."
404,""" Coming as it does , when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment , this suit is in direct contravention of the government ' s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15 ,"" the statement added ."
405,"A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco ' s court petition , adding : "" Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial ."""
406,"Meanwhile , Ramon Diaz , the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year , said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen ."
407,"The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "" A "" shares , which can only be owned by Filipinos , and 14 mln "" B "" shares which are available to foreign buyers ."
408,SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers .
409,"They said the shares would be purchased by the & lt ; A . Soriano > group of companies , SMC , Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors ."
410,Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB .
411,"The sale was aborted when Diaz ' s Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco , a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos ."
412,Cojuangco lives in self - imposed exile in the U . S ..
413,The shares grew to 38 . 1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June .
414,""" We have no objection to Soriano buying the "" B "" shares ,"" Diaz told Reuters ."
415,""" But everything is on hold now ."""
416,"The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company ' s annual stockholders ' meeting , scheduled for May 14 ."
417,"San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12 . 2 billion pesos in 1986 , 11 pct above its 10 . 9 billion peso sales in 1985 ."
418,"It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos , an increase of about 50 pct over 1985 ."
419,"RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture - stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay - Burdekin region of Queensland ' s central coast , an Australian Sugar Producers ' Association spokesman said ."
420,"As previously reported , the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell , partly relieved by scattered rainfall , since December , following the virtual failure of the summer wet season ."
421,"Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began , the spokesman said from Brisbane ."
422,"Although the Mackay - Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was , there will be some cane losses , the spokesman said ."
423,But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub - soil moisture .
424,"Elsewhere , in far north Queensland , the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland , the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops , he said ."

436,"The market had recovered slightly to around 1 . 72 dlrs a lb yesterday from its four year low of 1 . 55 dlrs in early January , due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries , but Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year ' s buoyant levels , which should ease current tightness ."
437,Output reductions by producers will take effect later this year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere .
438,"Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in balance during 1987 , with total non - Socialist world demand at 556 , 000 tonnes , compared with an estimated 544 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , production at 505 , 000 tonnes ( 504 , 000 ) and imports from Socialist countries at 47 , 000 tonnes ( 50 , 000 )."

444,POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth .
445,"In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here , Poehl said "" It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit ."""
446,"He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation , inflation and more depreciation if it took that route ."
447,Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U . S .
448,"Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy , accelerating tax cuts , cutting interest rates and tolerating above - target money supply growth ."
449,"He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year , but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament ."
450,"But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark , he said ."
451,"Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one - third of its gross national product , so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home ."
452,""" A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth ,"" he said ."
453,"Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors , including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade , had given some extra leeway ."
454,But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy .
455,"The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct , not the reported negative inflation rates last year , and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments ."
456,""" For the time being , we will have to focus our policy more on the external side , and we can live with a more expansionary money supply ."
457,"But we must be very careful ,"" he said ."
458,"He said he shared some of the U . S . Concern about Japan ' s trade surpluses , which affected European countries as well as the United States ."
459,"Poehl welcomed the so - called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries , saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated ."
460,"All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level , and that further changes would damage growth , he said ."
461,""" This was a remarkable change in attitude , especially on the part of our American colleagues ,"" he said ."
462,But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar ' s value could overshoot .

540,PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire ( D - Wis ) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders .
541,"Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers , Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses ."
542,""" We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure , would be fairer to all shareholders , and would insure that takeovers are properly financed ,"" he said ."
543,"Among the provisions , the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days , Proxmire said ."
544,"In addition , there would be a pre - notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC ."
545,Proxmire said the pre - notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts .
546,Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days .
547,His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer .
548,"To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers , Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced ."
549,"The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock , but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers ."
550,"Rather , the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money , Proxmire said ."
551,He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve ' s 50 pct margin requirements .
552,The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover .
553,""" When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it ,"" Proxmire said ."
554,Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two - tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment .
555,He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills .

560,Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium - and long - term debt on February 22 .
561,"U . S . banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue , but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "" the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90 - day limit in the second quarter of 1987 ."""
562,"Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987 , Bankers Trust estimated that full - year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs ."
563,Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments .
564,The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90 - day rollover of some 9 . 5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15 .

568,STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today ' s meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates .
569,Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then - current levels .
570,But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today .
571,"Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement , also known as the Louvre accord , had been underestimated ."
572,"Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago , at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners ."
573,""" There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord ,"" he said ."
574,""" We will be looking at ways of strengthening it , but I do not want to discuss that here ."
575,"Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a "" slight firming "" of the yen against the dollar ."
576,And Poehl noted that the dollar / mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar .
577,""" The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market ,"" he said ."
578,Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth .
579,"Poehl said , however , that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation ."
580,""" And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress ,"" he added ."
581,"Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar , noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade - weighted basis ."
582,""" You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy ."
583,"And it is not just a German problem , it is a European problem ,"" he said ."

732,"PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY Cheap oil feedstocks , the weakened U . S . dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U . S . petrochemical industry to record profits this year , with growth expected through at least 1990 , major company executives predicted ."
733,"This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp & lt ; GAF >, privately - held Cain Chemical Inc , and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants ."
734,"Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc & lt ; ASH >, the Kentucky - based oil refiner and marketer , are also shopping for money - making petrochemical businesses to buy ."
735,""" I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period ,"" said Paul Oreffice , chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co & lt ; DOW >, adding , "" There ' s no major plant capacity being added around the world now ."
736,"The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones ."""
737,"Analysts say the chemical industry ' s biggest customers , automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics , are expected to buy quantities this year ."
738,"U . S . petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity , reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year , said John Dosher , managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston ."
739,"Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct , he said ."
740,"Oreffice , speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston , said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history ."
741,"In 1985 , when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U . S . dollar , Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs ."
742,""" I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it ,"" Oreffice said ."
743,GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U . S . chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 .
744,"Last year , the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs , a 54 pct leap from 1985 ."
745,"The turn in the fortunes of the once - sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning , said Pace ' s John Dosher ."
746,Dosher said last year ' s fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies .
747,That helped boost U . S . chemical exports .
748,Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s .
749,"Finally , virtually all major U . S . chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants , trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses ."
750,The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts .
751,"GAF , which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp & lt ; UK >, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp & lt ; BOR >, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals ."
752,"Another industry powerhouse , W . R . Grace & lt ; GRA > has divested its retailing , restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions ."
753,"But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities , such as ethylene , in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom - designed for a small group of buyers ."
754,""" Companies like DuPont & lt ; DD > and Monsanto Co & lt ; MTC > spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated ,"" Dosher said ."
755,""" But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market ."""
756,Some top chemical executives share the concern .
757,""" The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes ,"" GAF ' s Heyman cautioned ."
758,""" The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill - advised ."
759,"Specialty businesses do not stay special long ."""
760,"Houston - based Cain Chemical , created this month by the Sterling investment banking group , believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend ."
761,"Chairman Gordon Cain , who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont ' s Conoco Inc ' s chemical business , has spent 1 . 1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast ."
762,The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products .
763,""" This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous , high - margin business ,"" Cain said , adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually ."
764,"Garo Armen , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds , said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum , wood and steel products ."
765,"Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years , provided the U . S . economy continues its modest rate of growth ."

805,"COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices , sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance ( CPA ) said ."
806,The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11 - member CPA which began on Monday .
807,They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices .
808,Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon .
809,"Prices , under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses , recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules ."
810,The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre - set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise .
811,""" The world ' s cocoa price at present is just not interesting ,"" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer ."
812,"Another source said that with much of the 1986 / 87 ( October - September ) world cocoa crop sold , limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year ' s harvest ."
813,"The sources noted , however , that the cocoa industry in Brazil , the world ' s number two producer , is in private hands ."
814,"This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers , where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards ."

832,Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72 . 6 mln and trust income increased to 95 . 9 mln dlrs from 75 . 9 mln .
833,"Morgan said other operating income , mainly fees and commissions , rose to 102 . 2 mln dlrs from 88 . 4 mln , but net investment securities gains dropped to 43 . 1 mln from 58 . 1 mln ."
834,"Net interest earnings were 490 . 4 mln dlrs in the first quarter , down from 499 . 4 mln a year earlier , and net yield fell to 2 . 79 pct from 3 . 20 pct ."
835,"If Brazil had not been placed on non - accrual , which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received , net interest earnings would have been 525 . 9 mln dlrs and net yield 2 . 99 pct ."
836,"If Brazil does not resume payments , 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs , Morgan added ."

843,"Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito , speaking from Brasilia , told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year ' s estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost ."
844,"He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting , but that most of it would stem from storage problems ."
845,"Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes , theoretically sufficient for the crop ."
846,But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed .
847,"The states of Sao Paulo , Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation ' s capacity , but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production ."
848,"The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre - West growing regions , where rising production has outpaced storage capacity ."
849,"Brito said the Centre - West , whose crops include soya and maize , had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation ' s grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space ."
850,"In addition to the poor distribution of storage units , there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks , while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain , Brito said ."
851,"Finally , there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops ."

954,JAPAN IN LAST - DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last - ditch effort to avert new high U . S . tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports .
955,"Makoto Kuroda , vice minister of Japan ' s Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U . S . Trade Representative , Michael Smith , and the Under Secretary of Commerce , Bruce Smart ."
956,"The new tariffs , to go into effect on April 17 , are in retaliation for Japan ' s failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U . S . semiconductor shipments ."
957,"They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors , including television and audio equipment and computers ."
958,Both U . S . and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments .
959,President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U . S .- Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U . S . officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement .
960,"In making the annoucement , Reagan said "" I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade ."""
961,"Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan ' s semiconductor trade practices , which are said to have injured the U . S . semiconductor industry , as Congress , which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues ."
962,"Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan ' s inaction to redress the growing U . S . trade deficit , which last year reached 169 . 8 billion dlrs ."
963,About one - third of the deficit was with Japan .
964,Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it .
965,Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation .
966,He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan ' s decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI ' s power to control Japanese traders .
967,""" The United States has excessive expectations .,"" he said ."
968,"To stabilize supply - demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time ."""

1008,"HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS , WIDER PENETRATION Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7 . 5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986 , despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration ."
1009,"Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders , after 265 mln in 1985 ."
1010,"Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company , Europe ' s leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986 , said sales increased by 6 . 3 pct to 42 . 1 mln hectoliters ."
1011,"The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U . S ., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand , and in Europe , where sales accounted for 25 . 5 pct of the total ."
1012,"Turnover , despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies , rose by 4 . 4 pct , to 6 . 7 billion guilders ."
1013,"Further consolidation of foreign companies , including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery & lt ; El Aguila S . A .> to 51 . 2 pct , new ventures and modernization , particularly in French and Spanish interests , eroded profit margins ."
1014,"The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing , Heineken said ."
1015,"Heineken ' s Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year , Heineken said , adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year ."
1016,Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe ' s biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken .
1017,""" We have the beer , but distribution and sales is the important point ,"" van Schaik said , adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures ."
1018,""" The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market , but how we are to do it ,"" van Schaik said , adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer , the internal structure was very regionalized ."
1019,"Heineken board member Hans Coebergh , responsible for African operations , said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term ."
1020,"He said the company , present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25 , was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there ."
1021,"Africa , where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks , nonetheless accounted for 6 . 5 pct of total 1986 sales ."
1022,On - site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients .
1023,But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities .
1024,"To balance the costs of imported malt , Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum , which had sold successfully , Coebergh said ."
1025,"Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials , but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda ."
1026,""" This is a possibility , but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor ,"" Coebergh said ."
1027,Chairman Heineken said the company ' s seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced .
1028,"But again , a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken ' s market potential ."

1463,DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year ' s federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U . S . trade deficit or buoy the economy .
1464,The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion - dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs .
1465,"Similarly , the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year ."
1466,""" In terms of the economy , 37 - 38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal , so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit ,"" said Stanley Collander , a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst ."
1467,""" At best , it will have a small positive effect ,"" Collander said in an interview ."
1468,Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar .
1469,The U . S . government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar .
1470,But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar ' s value is fraught with danger .
1471,"Such a decline , he has said , could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit ."
1472,"In addition , in February , U . S . officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels ."
1473,"As part of that agreement , Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit ."
1474,"The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit , Volcker said recently , is to reduce U . S . consumption , particularly federal spending ."
1475,""" If you don ' t deal with the budget deficit , everything else you do is going to be counterproductive ,"" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee ."
1476,Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government ' s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States .
1477,Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession .
1478,Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none .
1479,But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets .
1480,""" There ' s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps , but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed ' s flexibility to conduct monetary policy , then the answer is , it ' s not enough ,"" Silvia told Reuters ."
1481,The U . S . trade deficit has become one of the government ' s most vexing and persistent problems .
1482,"The 1986 deficit was 169 . 8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year ' s figure will be any lower , though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year ' s end ."
1483,"In the past , Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget ."
1484,"On the other hand , he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986 - 1991 period by last year ' s Gramm - Rudman balanced budget law ."
1485,"While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year ' s federal deficit , both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs ."
1486,""" For political reasons , 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you ' re going to get "" out of Congress at the present time , said Touche Ross ' s Collander ."
1487,""" To do something more than that would be extraordinary , remarkable and very , very difficult ."""
1488,Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels .
1489,""" To an extent , this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level ,"" he explained ."
1490,""" Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street ."""
1491,The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year .
1492,The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18 . 5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts .

1518,BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies .
1519,"In a lecture at the University of Surrey , pre - released here , Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements ."
1520,""" Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them ,"" he said ."
1521,He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1 . 80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 .
1522,"Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods , services and investments ."
1523,It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends .
1524,Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow .
1525,"To reverse such a rise in the money stock , interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off ."
1526,""" In other words , the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity ,"" Koehler said ."
1527,The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U . S . Current account deficit .
1528,But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems .
1529,The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U . S . Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports .
1530,But the volume effect of falling imports to the U . S . And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect .
1531,""" Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term ,"" Koehler said ."
1532,A reduction in the U . S . Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand .
1533,"In Japan and West Germany by contrast , domestic demand should rise faster than GNP ."
1534,""" In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986 ,"" Koehler said ."
1535,"If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented , the U . S . Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U . S .."
1536,But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U . S .
1537,"When selecting monetary policy instruments , a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions ."
1538,Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates .
1539,"It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability , economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem , the debt problem and the current account problem ."
1540,"A strategy had to be designed that helped "" the safeguarding of non - inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions ,"" Koehler said ."
1541,"Given the system of floating exchange rates , it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene ."
1542,"It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set , because they were only testing points for the market , he said ."
1543,"In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies , Koehler said ."

1572,""" Suddenly they ' re standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense , they ' re at a loss ( as to ) how to face the situation ."""
1573,Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain ' s Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan ' s lucrative overseas telephone business .
1574,"The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups , arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd , which now monopolizes the business ."
1575,It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non - Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists .
1576,"The ministry ' s stance has outraged both London , which has threatened to retaliate , and Washington , which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan ' s failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market ."
1577,Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U . S . Firms to Japan ' s car telephone and satellite communications market .

1616,Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates .

1913,"The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals , and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed , he said ."
1914,"He also noted that this test of the G - 7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen , while other currencies , especially the mark , had remained stable ."
1915,Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental .
1916,""" As I said at a time of Louvre ( agreement ), the expression of ' current level ' is rather vague idea ,"" he said ."
1917,"The yen ' s movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury , he said ."
1918,"It was better to give a vague expression than pin - pointing a level , which could have an adverse impact on the market , Miyazawa said ."
1919,"Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement , he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable ."

2140,"Monetary sources said they believed that U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo ' s package , announced yesterday , to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy ."
2141,"But yesterday ' s statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen ' s rise from around 153 to the dollar , the level at the February 22 Paris Accord , to about 145 today ."
2142,"And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals , even though the countries appear to do so ."
2143,The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan .
2144,"Kiichi Miyazawa , Japan ' s Finance Minister , said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks ."
2145,""" I would say that what has happened ( to the yen ) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris ,"" Miyazawa said yesterday ."
2146,"The supplementary budget worth about 34 . 48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa ' s departure for Washington , to attend yesterday ' s meetings of leading industrial nations ."
2147,"In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action "" extraordinary and urgent "", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals , or economic reality ."
2148,"The Group of Seven -- the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability ."
2149,The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar ' s fall .
2150,"While relatively unsuccessful , the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years ."
2151,Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement .
2152,They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium - term policies has replaced the bickering over short - term differences in past meetings .
2153,"West Germany , whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement , appears from the face of yesterday ' s statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable ."
2154,Bonn ' s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan ' s trade surpluses and America ' s trade deficit have already taken place .
2155,"No mention was made , however , of the U . S . commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris ."
2156,European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U . S . trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year .
2157,A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker .
2158,"A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "" clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability ,"" he said ."
2159,Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates .
2160,"Monetary sources said that , privately , West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U . S . unit ."
2161,"Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo ' s export drive to the United States , the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets ."
2162,"The ministers , meanwhile , also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one , Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson , said good progress was made ."
2163,Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations .
2164,"The United States and France , backed by the International Monetary Fund , want the seven to agree on ranges or "" norms "" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth , inflation , monetary conditions , trade balances and current account balances ."
2165,Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required .
2166,"But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried , monetary sources say , because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones ."
2167,The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting .
2168,The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years .
2169,BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED The Bank of France said it left its intervention rate unchanged at 7 - 3 / 4 pct when it injected funds in the market against first category paper in today ' s money market intervention tender .
2170,Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on the possibility of quarter point cut .
2171,"The rate was last adjusted on March 9 , when it was cut to 7 - 3 / 4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January ."
2172,"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS The global economy is expected to weaken this year , adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook , economic analysts said ."
2173,"For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week ' s semi - annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern ."
2174,"The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2 . 7 pct this year , versus 2 . 9 pct last year , and 3 . 1 pct in 1985 ."
2175,"In the industrial countries , Gross National Product , a measure of all goods and services , was expected to decline to 2 . 3 pct this year , compared with 2 . 4 pct in 1986 , the IMF said ."
2176,"For the developing countries , the Gross Domestic Product , another measure of economic growth , was expected to fall to 3 . 0 pct from 3 . 5 pct last year ."
2177,The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries .
2178,They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt .
2179,"IMF officials , discussing their outlook , said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade ."
2180,Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth .
2181,"Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance , economic weakness in the developed nations ' economies poses fundamental worries ."
2182,"Debtor countries , including the very poorest states , have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange , including the key one of exports ."
2183,"The U . S . economy , which is in its fifth year of expansion , has served as a mainstay for developing country exports , but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year , growing by only 2 . 3 pct , according to the IMF ."
2184,"For this reason and because of a high trade deficit , the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success ."
2185,The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U . S . trade deficit .
2186,"Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up , although it has been much slower than expected ."
2187,"The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "" it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect ."""
2188,"The report added , however , "" the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion ."""

2190,"SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES The head of Spain ' s employers ' federation , Jose Maria Cuevas , said employers were worried about the government ' s monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment ."
2191,He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government ' s five pct inflation target .
2192,"The government ' s perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary , he said ."
2193,"High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government ' s target for monetary growth , Cuevas said ."
2194,"Spain ' s most closely - watched measure of money supply , liquid assets in public hands , grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March , against 11 . 4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6 . 5 to 9 . 5 pct for 1987 ."
2195,"To combat this , the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year , to 14 . 5 pct at present from 11 . 8 at end - 1986 ."
2196,"Cuevas said employers were heeding the government ' s call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year , with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5 . 6 pct in the first quarter of 1987 ."
2197,"These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers , Cuevas said , with the rest still in wage negotiations ."
2198,"He said Spain ' s current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector , where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling ."
2199,Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain ' s foreign trade balance .
2200,"The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas , a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year ."
2201,"However , employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance ."

2203,"LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector , traders said ."
2204,"Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in North America , they added ."
2205,London Metal Exchange ( LME ) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower .
2206,"This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady , if unspectacular , physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed ."
2207,"The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which , as peak winter demand tails off , stocks usually build fast and availability increases , traders said ."
2208,The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe .
2209,"Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems , lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz ' s smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks ."
2210,"In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters ' Port Pirie , South Australia , smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance ."
2211,"Although the company said it would meet commitments , this will put further pressure on stocks ."
2212,"And the U . S . Company Doe Run has kept its 140 , 000 tonnes per year Boss , Montana smelter closed ."
2213,"This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply / demand balance within the U . S . Market , for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market ."
2214,"Mexican supplies , which have sometimes swelled LME stocks , have been normal but are finding ready buyers , traders said ."
2215,"On the demand side , winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U . S . Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U . K . Soviet lead buying , notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year , was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March ."
2216,Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery .
2217,Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses .
2218,"Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR , traders said ."
2219,"On stocks , the popular LME Continental warehouses , Antwerp and Rotterdam , have little more than 3 , 000 tonnes of lead each , and this is believed to be in strong hands ."
2220,"Out of a total 22 , 125 tonnes in LME stocks , the lowest level since June 1980 , just over half is in U . K ."
2221,Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments .
2222,"But even U . K . Stocks have dropped around 6 , 000 tonnes since the start of the year ."
2223,"Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls , which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries ."
2224,"Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices , with contracts expiring end - April at Cominco ' s Trail and Kimberley , B . C ., Mine / smelter and at Doe Run ' s Herculaneum , Mo , smelter ."
2225,Noranda ' s New Brunswick mine / smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months .
2226,"Traders said LME three months delivery , already attracting speculative buying , could rise to 320 / 330 stg on current firmness , while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four ."

2295,"One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1 . 5 billion marks , but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "" upper limit ."""

2297,VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed .
2298,VW ' s former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice .
2299,Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits .

2800,HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U . S .
2801,STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committee has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled materials for national defense to the U . S . Defense Secretary .
2802,"The committee also voted for legally - binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials , mostly metals ."
2803,The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month .
2804,"The purpose of the measures , passed by the committee yesterday , is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell - offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs , a staff member of the committee told Reuters ."
2805,""" They ( the stockpiles ) stand to gain the most by being managed properly ,"" said the staffer ."
2806,""" Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious ."""
2807,"Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ."
2808,The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials .
2809,The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile .
2810,The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials .
2811,He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit .

2816,""" Hopefully it ' s the beginning of a trend ,"" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto ."
2817,"Economists generally don ' t expect such large gains over the next months , but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year ."
2818,""" We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year , and it certainly looks as if this morning ' s figure is indicative of that ,"" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd . Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3 . 2 billion dls in the month ."
2819,""" Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5 . 9 pct in February ,"" the agency said in its monthly report ."
2820,"Total exports expanded to 10 . 44 billion dlrs from 9 . 85 billion dlrs in February , while imports slipped to 9 . 19 billion dlrs from 9 . 23 billion dlrs ."
2821,Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year ' s dismal 10 . 1 billion dlr total .

2828,Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy .
2829,"They say the country ' s consumers , who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years , will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country ."
2830,"Meanwhile , demand for Canadian exports in the United States , by far the country ' s largest market , is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency ."
2831,""" We maintain what ' s going to drive Canada ' s export performance is income growth in the U . S .,"" said Midland ' s Donegan ."
2832,"But at the Bank of Nova Scotia , deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U . S . outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February ' s trade upturn ."

2969,HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U . S .
2970,STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committee has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled materials for national defense to the U . S . Defense Secretary .
2971,"The committee also voted for legally - binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials , mostly metals ."
2972,The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month .
2973,"The purpose of the measures , passed by the committee yesterday , is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell - offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs , a staff member of the committee told Reuters ."
2974,""" They ( the stockpiles ) stand to gain the most by being managed properly ,"" said the staffer ."
2975,""" Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious ."""
2976,"Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ."
2977,The staffer said that under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials .
2978,The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile .
2979,The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials .
2980,He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit .
2981,"These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce , he said ."
2982,"The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile management was counter - productive , he said ."

3211,"U . S . OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL The United States ' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid - 1990s , according to John H . Lichtblau , president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates ."
3212,"Lichtblau , speaking at an alternative energy conference here , said the U . S . may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995 , surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977 ."
3213,""" The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable ,"" Lichtblau said ."
3214,"As much as 30 pct of U . S . oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations , he said ."
3215,Lichtblau said the U . S . depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990 .
3216,""" However , the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction ,"" Lichtblau said ."
3217,He said that one of the government ' s negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration .
3218,Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices .
3219,""" An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U . S . than if we imposed it alone ,"" Lichtblau said ."
3220,"Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U . S . dependency on foreign oil , Lichtblau said ."
3221,"A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices , he said ."
3222,"Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling , to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy ."

3390,""" But I do suggest ,"" he said , "" that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts ."""
3391,"He said that indicators can serve "" as a kind of compass "" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies ."

3406,U . S . DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the U . S . dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability .
3407,"Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York , where gold jumped 12 . 40 dlrs and closed at 436 . 50 dlrs a troy ounce , and silver 22 . 5 cents to 6 . 86 dlrs a troy ounce ."
3408,"A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U . S . dollar , said Steve Chronowitz , director of commodity research with Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co ., in New York ."
3409,"The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value , and despite reports of intervention by the U . S . Federal Reserve Bank , traders said ."
3410,"Traders said it appears that the industrial nations , known as the Group of Seven , lack the ability to change the long - term direction of the currency markets ."
3411,""" Maybe they have some ideas or plans ,"" said Chronowitz ."
3412,""" If they do , it ' s not evident ."""
3413,""" It looks like there ' s no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be ."
3414,""" One way or another , we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies ,"" as a measure to correct the mounting U . S . trade deficit , Chronowitz said ."
3415,""" I think the markets believe , and have believed for a long time , that the only recourse is to reflate at some point ."
3416,"It ' s going to be a long and tedious process , but that ' s what ' s happening ,"" he said ."
3417,"The falling value of the dollar makes U . S . commodities cheaper for foreign buyers , stimulating demand ."
3418,"At the same time , traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge , said Marty McNeill , a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick ."
3419,"The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets , as grains , livestock , and cotton posted broad gains ."
3420,Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand .
3421,"After the close of trading , the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month - earlier report ."
3422,"Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , while live cattle were moderately higher ."

3470,"ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar , despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two - week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday ."
3471,"Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday , up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period ."
3472,Wednesday borrowings were 1 . 4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6 . 45 pct .
3473,""" One could make a case that the Fed is firming , but it probably isn ' t ,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds ."
3474,Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two - weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months .
3475,"However , the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two - week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings ."
3476,""" Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy , but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn ' t quite make it ,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ."
3477,A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one - day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday .
3478,"Still , McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed ."
3479,"The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday , the first two days of the week ."
3480,It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday .
3481,"Based on Fed data out today , economists calculated that the two - day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5 . 9 billion dlrs ."
3482,They put Wednesday ' s overnight System repos at approximately 3 . 4 billion dlrs .
3483,""" It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time ,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S . G . Warburg and Co Inc ."
3484,"Citing the view shared by the other two economists , Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders ."
3485,""" Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled ,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch ."
3486,He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday ' s Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid .
3487,"In fact , currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday ' s G - 7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan ."
3488,The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6 - 1 / 8 pct .
3489,This is about where the rate has been since early November .
3490,""" I ' m not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar , as some suspect ,"" said Sullivan of Dean Witter ."

3526,"For two years , the markets had hailed the dollar ' s decline as the cure - all for the U . S . Trade deficit ."
3527,"Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one - way street , up ."
3528,But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker ' s often - repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse .
3529,""" Volcker ' s been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he ' s got it ,"" said David Jones , economist at Aubrey G . Lanston and Co Inc ."
3530,"The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances , short of further depreciation of the dollar ."
3531,"Bonds suffered their biggest one - day drop in months amid worries that the dollar ' s slide will rekindle inflation , scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit ."
3532,"The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432 . 20 / 70 dlrs an ounce , while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339 ."
3533,"Norman Robertson , Mellon Bank chief economist , called the markets ' instability frightening ."
3534,"He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "" once you start the ball rolling it ' s difficult to stop ."""
3535,""" There ' s a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession ."
3536,"The markets are in a panic ."""
3537,"Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington , has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3 . 47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare ."
3538,""" We ' re still more or less on track for a hard landing ..."
3539,"But the agony may be fairly drawn out ,"" Marris told Reuters ."
3540,"Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year , but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing , whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession ."
3541,The stock market ' s reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about .
3542,"The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience , which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline , Marris said ."
3543,He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen .
3544,"Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar ' s latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen , the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G - 7 Paris agreement in February ."
3545,"Robertson at Mellon , by contrast , said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports , raising the specter of a debilitating trade war ."
3546,"Many economists believe that long - run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U . S ., Reflected in the massive budget deficit ."
3547,"But in the short term , given the failure of the G - 7 and of central bank intervention , some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar ."
3548,""" The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad , at least by Japan ,"" said Lanston ' s Jones ."
3549,"Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates , even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers , Latin American governments and others ."
3550,"But Robert Giordano , chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co , scoffed at the notion ."
3551,""" It ' s ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency ."
3552,"This is yen strength , not dollar weakness ,"" he said ."
3553,Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U . S . Budget deficit .
3554,""" We ' re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year , and nobody cares ,"" he said , noting that only the deficit cut in 1968 - 69 will have been greater ."
3555,He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year .
3556,"But for now , market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out ."
3557,""" Put on your helmets ,"" Giordano said ."

3560,JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate .
3561,They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven ( G - 7 ) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate .
3562,They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all .
3563,Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates .
3564,The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G - 7 pact a failure .
3565,"The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar ' s renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo , which was sparked by remarks by U . S . Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar ' s fall had been orderly ."
3566,"They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker ' s comments because he was referring to the dollar ' s fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985 , over a long - time span , not the currency ' s recent movements ."
3567,They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other .
3568,The Bank of Japan sources said the U . S . Is putting more weight on the dollar / yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies .
3569,"Throughout the G - 7 meeting , Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U . S ., Hurting the U . S . And world economies , they said ."
3570,"In February and in March of this year , Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U . S . Treasury bonds , the sources said ."
3571,"Each country in the G - 7 - Britain , Canada , France , Italy , Japan , the U . S . And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability , the Bank of Japan sources said ."
3572,"This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar / yen , European currencies / yen and dollar / European currencies ."
3573,"At the time of the Louvre agreement , European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening , they said ."
3574,"AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL Union and New South Wales government officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers compensation , averting increased industrial action in the state , union sources said ."
3575,"But some unions , including those of building and mining workers , said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would continue their strikes for a few more days ."
3576,State officials said the government had agreed to revise its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly higher cash benefits for injured workers .

3785,"Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4 . 5 billion dlrs by July 1 , 1987 , when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire ."
3786,Analysts said TransCanada ' s bid signals Dome ' s debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome ' s debt plan .
3787,Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations .
3788,"TransCanada ' s proposal "" amounts to a quasi debt restructuring ,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto ."
3789,Calgary - based Dome ' s restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated .
3790,Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt .
3791,""" The weakness of the whole debt - refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors , there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations ,"" said Wilf Gobert , an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary ."
3792,"TransCanada ' s announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages , Gobert said ."
3793,"The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring , he added ."
3794,""" I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers ( for Dome ),"" Gobert said ."
3795,Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada ' s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer .
3796,""" By drawing attention to us in our discussions , it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward ,"" he said ."
3797,"Dome does not consider TransCanada ' s proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility ' s announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies , he said ."
3798,Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties .
3799,"However , Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals , including TransCanada ' s ."
3800,Gowland said TransCanada ' s offer is probably a fair price for the company ' s 36 . 1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings .

3813,"Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness , or at least the ability , of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC ."
3814,"However , they said an all - out trade war may be far off , as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan ."
3815,Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U . S .

3823,"However , British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened ."
3824,"By contrast , West Germany , with the EC ' s most successful economy , has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions , preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan ."
3825,"The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years , substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas ."
3826,"At present , it is , for instance , pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits , to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport , and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars ."
3827,"EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits , but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non - tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount ."
3828,"They stress , however , that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar - my - neighbour action ."
3829,"One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam , they point out ."

3862,Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks .

3864,Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross - rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain .
3865,""" We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board , the levy collection agency , has interpreted the levy regulations correctly , but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law ,"" Pex said ."
3866,""" It is only with great regret that we have taken this route , but we have had no political help , and therefore have no option even though it could take years ,"" Pex added ."

3899,INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago .
3900,"The three research groups of Kiel , Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes ' joint spring report that gross national product ( GNP ) would rise by two pct in 1987 , compared with 2 . 4 pct in 1986 ."
3901,The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year .
3902,"Taking a dissenting view , the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich ' s Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth ."
3903,"The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were "" markedly less favourable "" than those of the other three ."
3904,The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year .
3905,""" In the second half of 1987 there will , however , only be a weak upward movement ,"" they said ."
3906,The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year .
3907,They saw exports falling by a real 2 - 1 / 2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year .
3908,"The other three institutes , however , wrote : "" The decline in demand and production ( seen ) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing ."""
3909,They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans .
3910,But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off .
3911,""" It can be presumed that the braking actions ( on the economy ) will diminish markedly this year ."""
3912,"They added : "" The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable ."""
3913,These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring .
3914,"However , this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar ."
3915,"Contrary to the DIW and Ifo , the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987 , "" there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year ."""
3916,"They predicted an overall 0 . 5 pct fall in exports in 1987 , the same as in 1986 ."
3917,"The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987 , compared with 4 . 2 pct in 1986 , while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase ."
3918,They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4 . 6 pct in 1986 .
3919,Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct .
3920,All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment .
3921,"The Kiel , Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2 . 17 mln in 1987 compared with 2 . 23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200 , 000 ."
3922,These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures .
3923,The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion .
3924,"The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector , while "" the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline ."""
3925,The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2 . 20 mln in 1987 from 2 . 23 mln in 1986 .

3997,WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990 .
3998,"In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts , with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth ."
3999,Gross national product grew 2 . 4 pct last year .
4000,"But the report said all the institutes believed that "" more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created ."""
4001,The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible .
4002,""" From this point of view , the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward ."""
4003,The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform .
4004,The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks .
4005,"However , the institutes criticised the government , not only for the timing of the reform , but also because the question of its financing had been left open ."
4006,"The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for , though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies ."
4007,The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government .
4008,"They also said the government should reduce tax preferences , which would simplify the fiscal system , urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value - added tax ."
4009,The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged .
4010,They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies .
4011,"The institutes said total subsidies , including tax preferences , had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then ."
4012,"Given the scope of these subsidies , it should be possible "" despite ... Major political difficulties "" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts ."
4013,The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost .
4014,The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed .
4015,"The government had to aim for more competition , it said ."

4071,U . S .- Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York .

4095,"The year - on - year rise was put at 3 . 7 pct , down from 4 . 2 pct in February ."
4096,"But Chris Tinker , economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew , said the drop in the year - on - year rate mainly reflected a rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last year ."
4097,"He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into the monthly figure , adding that a rise of only 0 . 2 pct in April would take the year - on - year rise back above 4 . 2 pct ."
4098,Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers ' input prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors such as a fall in industrial electricity costs .
4099,Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected .
4100,"Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input costs down over the next few months , although Tinker added that last year ' s fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the year - on - year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to rises in the index rather than falls ."

4110,Italy ' s budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2 . 7 pct in real terms from 1985 .
4111,"Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26 , 361 billion lire , down 1 . 4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6 . 6 pct from the third 1986 quarter , ISTAT said ."
4112,"Istat said exports totaled 23 , 190 billion lire in the fourth quarter , down 4 . 1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6 . 7 pct from the third quarter in 1986 ."

4114,"G - 7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION Top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies , which they believe they strengthened in talks last week ."
4115,"Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets , which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too , did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada ."
4116,"Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement , and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying : "" I don ' t believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar ."""
4117,"West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollar ' s latest rapid descent "" involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation , leading to a renewed rise in interest rates ."""
4118,"But there were signs too , that while policymakers feared the market uproar , they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed , and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result ."
4119,Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week ' s semi - annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher U . S . Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar ' s rapid descent .
4120,That distaste stems in part from fears of recession .
4121,Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the U . S . trade deficit .
4122,""" It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us , if not ( into ) recession , into slower growth ,"" he said ."
4123,"Asked if higher U . S . Interest rates would stabilize the dollar , Balladur said : "" When a currency is maintained artificially high , by artificially high interest rates , it is not healthy ."""
4124,"And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession , he said ."
4125,"Acknowledging the dollar ' s latest slide was now a fact of life , Balladur said , "" there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies , this is not a fixed rate system ."""
4126,But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar ' s slide deepens .
4127,U . S . Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the seven ' s commitments were genuine .
4128,""" The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements ,"" Baker told the meetings ."
4129,Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar .
4130,"Baker , Darman said , was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels ."
4131,Last week ' s statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism .
4132,"West Germany and Japan , meanwhile , agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn ."
4133,Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan ' s promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget .
4134,The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action .
4135,"But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today ' s exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement , when the dollar stood higher ."
4136,"The Paris accord said , "" currencies ( are ) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals , given the policy commitments summarized in this statement ."""
4137,"Now they accept the dollar ' s lower level , especially against the yen , as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement ."
4138,""" The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals ,"" last week ' s statement read ."
4139,Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the U . S . Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes .
4140,European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit .
4141,"INSTITUTES SEE NO WEST GERMAN RECESSION The five leading West German economic research institutes , which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth , do not predict a recession in West Germany , their spokesman , Hans - Juergen Schmahl said ."

4191,"Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4 . 5 billion dlrs by July 1 , 1987 , when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire ."
4192,Analysts said TransCanada ' s bid signals Dome ' s debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome ' s debt plan .
4193,Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations .
4194,"TransCanada ' s proposal "" amounts to a quasi debt restructuring ,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto ."
4195,Calgary - based Dome ' s restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated .
4196,Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt .
4197,""" The weakness of the whole debt - refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors , there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations ,"" said Wilf Gobert , an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary ."
4198,"TransCanada ' s announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages , Gobert said ."
4199,"The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring , he added ."
4200,""" I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers ( for Dome ),"" Gobert said ."
4201,Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada ' s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer .
4202,""" By drawing attention to us in our discussions , it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward ,"" he said ."
4203,"Dome does not consider TransCanada ' s proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility ' s announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies , he said ."
4204,Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties .
4205,"However , Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals , including TransCanada ' s ."
4206,Gowland said TransCanada ' s offer is probably a fair price for the company ' s 36 . 1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings .

4209,"In a newspaper advertisement , Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp , withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended ."
4210,The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15 .
4211,"In late March , Sosnoff said he had received a "" negligible "" number of shares in response to the offer , which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate ."
4212,"Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars ' 30 mln common shares now outstanding , or a 13 . 3 pct interest on a primary basis ."
4213,"Last week , Caesars ' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share , subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June ."
4214,The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout .
4215,"Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing , as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities ."
4216,He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars ' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction .
4217,"Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29 . 1 mln shares he is now seeking , together with the 4 , 217 , 675 shares he owns , would give him a 92 . 4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis ."
4218,"He said he still has received only a "" negligible "" number of shares in response to his tender ."
4219,"In a letter to Caesars ' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement , Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused , on April 8 , to meet with him , even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer ."
4220,Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place .
4221,"Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc & lt ; PWJ > has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp , an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition ."

4223,"Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender , each of the 2 , 750 , 000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer , or 7 . 6 pct on a fully diluted basis , would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm ."
4224,"He said "" To the extent that fewer than 29 , 100 , 000 sdhares are purchased in the offer , the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars ."""
4225,Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars ' recapitalization .
4226,"Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval , a process that it already underway in New Jersey ."
4227,He said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process .
4228,He said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date .

4241,"Cavaco Silva ' s minority Social Democratic Party , PSD , was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left - wing parties ."
4242,The centre - right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office .

4250,Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts .
4251,"Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast , released on the day the PSD government fell , predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year ."
4252,But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development .
4253,"Soares , who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month , can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing - dominated parliament ."
4254,Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution .
4255,""" There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections ,"" Confederation of Portuguese Industry ( CIP ) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said ."
4256,He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year .
4257,"The left - wing parties favour a parliamentary solution , but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority ."
4258,"A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide - ranging reforms , such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry , the analysts said ."
4259,Cavaco Silva has accused the left - wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms .
4260,"The left - wingers said Portugal ' s positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports , than of PSD policies ."

4285,Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15 . 74 cts per mln Btu to 2 . 95 dlrs per mln .
4286,The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take - or - pay buyout costs .
4287,"It explained this interpretation was based on FERC ' s April 10 , 1985 , Statement of Policy which said that only take - or - pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act ."
4288,"As a result of renegotiating contracts for high - cost gas , Columbia Gas said , it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1 . 96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3 . 64 dlrs per mln in April 1985 ."

4294,"The diplomats also said , however , that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states , notably Poland ."
4295,"MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive , with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct ."
4296,"It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship , including higher pensions and family allowances ."

4374,GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY Four of West Germany ' s five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation .
4375,"But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin , echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials , said the expansion seen over the last 1 - 1 / 2 years did not necessarily threaten stability ."
4376,"The five institutes issued a joint spring report , in which three -- Kiel , Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987 , while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct ."
4377,The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity .
4378,But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy .
4379,"Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated , they said ."
4380,""" But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate , forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy ,"" they said ."
4381,"The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold , they said ."
4382,The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates .
4383,""" Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock , but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply ,"" they said ."
4384,"A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves , but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts , which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations ."
4385,The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential .
4386,Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account .
4387,Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation .
4388,Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability .

4600,Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait ' s 22 - tanker fleet .

4978,"EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE U . S . officials said they held out little hope the European Community , EC , would withdraw a controversial meat inspection requirement , due to go into effect April 30 and which U . S . meat producers claim will cut off their exports ."
4979,But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U . S . plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U . S . Agriculture Department .
4980,The EC ' s so - called Third Country Meat Directive will require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC inspection standards beginning April 30 .
4981,The U . S . meat industry has prepared a petition requesting the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule .
4982,At issue are U . S . meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln dlrs in 1985 .
4983,"The EC rule would require all U . S . plants to make changes in their inspection methods , ranging from veterinary staffing to use of wood ."
4984,"Last December , the EC determined that only one U . S . cattle , one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved without further review ."
4985,USDA would have to certify that the plants had corrected the deficiencies .
4986,All remaining plants with a history or potential of shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before further EC review .
4987,"Robert Hibbert , general counsel for the American Meat Institute , said the meat industry expected to submit a formal trade retaliation petition by April 30 ."
4988,An interagency committee is reviewing the industry ' s draft petition .
4989,"An official at the U . S . Trade Representative ' s Office said U . S . officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule , but that "" the chances of that are not too good at this time ."""
4990,"However , there is the "" expectation "" in U . S . government and meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow shipments , at least through the end of the calendar year , from U . S . plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring their operations into conformity with the EC regulation , the USTR official said ."
4991,"U . S . BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON Major U . S . banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar , economists said ."
4992,"In what was the first prime rate boost since mid - 1984 , most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7 - 3 / 4 pct , citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money ."
4993,That spread has narrowed again .
4994,""" A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight ,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc . Brusca said a quarter - point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks ' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point ."
4995,He said that spread had averaged around 1 . 4 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks .
4996,""" We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week ,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G . Lanston and Co . "" We ' ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future ,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp . "" Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs , you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now ,"" said Harold Nathan , economist at Wells Fargo Bank ."
4997,"However , he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates ."
4998,Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short - term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar .
4999,"He said "" if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high , a prime rate rise could occur at any time ."""
5000,Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U . S . inflation .
5001,"As the dollar fell to a 40 - year low against the yen Friday , currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar ."
5002,"In addition to buying dollars outright , another way to stabilize the U . S . currency would be for the Fed to push U . S . interest rates higher relative to overseas rates ."
5003,"Based particularly on the Fed ' s reserve management actions on Friday and today , Nathan of Wells Fargo said "" it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market ."
5004,"It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed ."""
5005,Bank funding costs and other short and long - term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy .
5006,That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected .
5007,"On Friday , the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6 - 5 / 16 pct ."
5008,"With funds trading even higher at 6 - 1 / 2 pct today , the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1 . 5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements ."
5009,""" The Fed ' s actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures ,"" said Jones of Lanston ."
5010,""" The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar ,"" Jones said ."
5011,"He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now , "" but to have a major impact on the dollar , the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point ."""
5012,"Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and , within four to six weeks , to raise its discount rate from 5 - 1 / 2 pct ."
5013,Jones said a U . S . discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar .
5014,"Given likely Fed policy firming , he said both the yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds ( about 8 . 30 pct now ) and the prime rate may be at 8 - 1 / 2 pct at end - June and nine pct by year ' s end ."
5015,""" The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar ,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp ."
5016,He said tax - date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately .
5017,Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy .

5283,"Dome rose 1 / 4 to 1 - 1 / 8 on the American Stock Exchange and gained 31 cents to 1 . 44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock Exchange , where it was the most active stock ."
5284,It rose as high as 1 . 50 dlrs in Toronto during the day .
5285,"In recent months , Dome has normally moved by only a few cents per day ."
5286,"TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4 . 3 billion dlr Canadian ( 3 . 22 billion U . S .) bid for all of Dome ' s assets , but Dome , which is based in Calgary , Alberta , said it is also still talking with two other companies , which it refuses to identify ."
5287,"Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies , noting that TransCanada yesterday stressed that its bid is "" a Canadian solution to the financial difficulties of Dome Petroleum ."""
5288,""" The talk is about Conoco , which is controlled by DuPont & lt ; DD >, and Atlantic Richfield Co & lt ; ARC >, which sold its Canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in ,"" said Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd .

5289,Calgary - based independent analyst James Hamilton has said in recent reports that Amoco Corp & lt ; AN > has also been in talks with Dome .
5290,"Representatives of Atlantic Richfield , British Petroleum , Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment ."
5291,"Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "" awfully optimistic ,"" given TransCanada ' s offer to give current Dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary , which it valued at 1 . 10 dlrs Canadian per common share ."
5292,"Under the offer , current Dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary , which would own and operate all Dome ' s former assets ."
5293,TransCanada would own 80 pct .
5294,"However , Bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly - traded subsidiary ."
5295,""" The TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome ,"" he said ."
5296,"Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "" at the upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome ."""
5297,"The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome ' s creditors 3 . 87 billion Canadian dlrs ( 2 . 90 billion U . S . dlrs ), with another one billion Canadian dlrs ( 750 mln U . S . dlrs ) available to secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level ."
5298,TransCanada would not detail the profit level .
5299,"Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion Canadian dlrs ( 4 . 5 billion U . S . dlrs ) in debt , which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand ."
5300,""" There has been speculation that Dome ' s assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs , so on that basis , the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that ,"" Gobert said ."
5301,Dome ' s debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field .
5302,It holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3 . 9 billion cubic feet of natural gas .
5303,"The company also owns or has an interest in 14 . 2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta , the heart of Canada ' s oil industry ."

5552,"JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS Basic reform of Japan ' s protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic - led growth , a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus , securities analysts said ."
5553,"The farm sector , which is protected by import tariffs and quotas , propped up by subsidies and price supports , and sheltered by the tax system , has ample room for change , they said ."
5554,""" In economic terms , reform would be a plus ,"" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co ."
5555,"The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U . S ., The analysts said ."
5556,"Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household ' s budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product ( GNP ), according to a study by Chew ."
5557,"Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct , his study said ."
5558,"The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth , it added ."

5568,External pressures are rising as the U . S . And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan .
5569,"But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched , dimming prospects for quick reform , analysts said ."
5570,"Although the full - time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies , the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas ."
5571,One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders .
5572,"The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon , the analysts said ."
5573,"Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security , they said ."

5580,The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index .
5581,The February increase was less than Janauary ' s 0 . 4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986 .
5582,Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1 . 9 pct year - on - year .
5583,"Retail energy prices rose by 0 . 3 pct , less than January ' s 1 . 1 pct increase ."
5584,"Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier , it said ."
5585,"Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0 . 3 pct in February , in line with previous months , although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U . S . And Britain ."
5586,"Among the leading seven industrial countries , consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 4 . 2 pct , followed by Canada at 4 . 0 pct , Britain at 3 . 9 pct , France at 3 . 4 pct , the U . S . At 2 . 1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 0 . 5 pct and 1 . 4 pct respectively ."
5587,"LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice , beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected ."
5588,"But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to Tokyo yesterday , Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan ' s agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets ."
5589,"""( The Japanese ) have said they are happy we are coming , but they are not going to give us anything ,"" Lyng said ."
5590,U . S . Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng ' s two - week visit here .
5591,"Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month , they said ."
5592,""" If there is anything of consequence to offer ( Prime Minister Yasuhiro ) Nakasone would take it with him ,"" when he visits Washington later in the month , one U . S . Official said ."
5593,Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases .
5594,"A private U . S . Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200 , 000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake ."
5595,"Japan has rejected the overture , saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self - sufficiency in rice ."
5596,Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed .
5597,He cited the example of a California company which transports live U . S . Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota .
5598,"The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal , he said ."
5599,"U . S . Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports , was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising ."
5600,Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports .
5601,"Along with beef , the U . S . Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April , 1988 ."
5602,Some U . S . Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry .
5603,"The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice , U . S . And Japanese officials have said ."
5604,"Lyng has resurrected a past U . S . Proposal that Japan buy surplus U . S . Foodgrains for donation to developing countries , but some U . S . Officials are skeptical action will be taken ."
5605,"Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies , including rice , on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva ."
5606,He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible U . S . Reprisals .
5607,"JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS Japan ' s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods , the head of the committee working out the plan , Junichiro Koizumi , said ."
5608,"The plan will also urge the government to double 1985 ' s official development assistance to 7 . 6 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised , senior LDP officials said at a press conference ."
5609,LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to U . S . Officials when he visits the U . S . On April 19 .
5610,Abe ' s visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone ' s talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month .
5611,Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated .
5612,"However , top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to U . S . Officials ."
5613,"The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers , LDP officials said ."
5614,"According to the plan , Japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries , the officials said ."
5615,"The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the U . S ., They added ."
5616,"The basic ideas of the LDP ' s plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week , they said ."
5617,The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May .

5626,"In Hong Kong , Baldrige will hold meetings on April 27 with Governor David Wilson and Trade and Industry Secretary Eric Ho , as well as addressing the American Chamber of Commerce ."

5629,"U . S . URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures , an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters ."
5630,"Hideo Maki , Director General of the ministry ' s Economic Affairs Bureau , quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States ."
5631,"The meeting with Kato opened a 12 - day visit to Japan by Lyng , who is here to dicuss farm trade ."
5632,"However , Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world ' s largest grain importer ."
5633,Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U . S .
5634,Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985 .
5635,Lyng said the U . S .
5636,Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U . S .
5637,"Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) last year , as well as on beef , citrus products and rice ."
5638,Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self - sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand .
5639,"The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries , he added ."
5640,"Lyng said the U . S . Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs , Maki said ."
5641,"Maki said the U . S . And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20 , in which U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join ."

5645,REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan ' s failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade .
5646,The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U . S . Trade Representative ' s Office .
5647,Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film .
5648,"The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara , where Reagan is vacationing ."
5649,"In his March annoucement , Reagan said "" I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities ."""
5650,He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U . S . products .
5651,U . S . officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan ' s plan to invoke the sanctions .
5652,"White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday : "" we do not want a trade war , but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action ."""
5653,"Reagan ' s move follows steadily rising U . S . trade deicits , with last year ' s hitting a record $ 169 . 8 billion ."
5654,About one - third of the deficit is in trade with Japan .
5655,Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices .
5656,"He has opposed the legislation , saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and , in any case , that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices ."
5657,Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation .
5658,"The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact , but that it would take time before the results showed up ."
5659,"U . S . officials , however , have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports ."
5660,"Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs , it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade ( GATT )."
5661,It said hoped GATT would find the U . S . retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation .
5662,U . S . officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States .

5742,""" My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup , and there is no question about it ,"" he said ."
5743,Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit .
5744,Miller ' s remarks reflected concern that the U . S . central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar .
5745,Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U . S . dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects .

5748,"Without giving figures , the report said last month ' s rise , partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost earlier this year through industrial action , was due mainly to a firming of domestic demand ."
5749,""" New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital goods where production will remain at its present level ,"" the report added ."

5757,YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned .
5758,"Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports , he said "" slim to none ."""
5759,Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan ' s failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U . S . products .
5760,"Yeutter , on the NBC program "" Today ,"" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement ."
5761,"He said Japanese negotiators last week told U . S . officials they were honoring the pact , but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance ."
5762,"Asked how long that would take , he said "" We want to see a pattern of compliance , so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks ."""
5763,Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers .

5765,""" It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict ."

5877,""" Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship ( with the United States ) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation ,"" Yeutter said ."

5891,"FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY U . S . banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy , but they do support the market ' s assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit , economists said ."
5892,""" It ' s clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat ."
5893,"Discount window borrowings , net free reserves , the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening ,"" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp . Johnson , and several other economists , now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6 - 1 / 4 and 6 - 3 / 8 pct ."
5894,"Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day , producing a daily average for the two - week statement period of 689 mln dlrs , the highest since the week of December 31 , 1986 , and up from 393 mln dlrs previously ."
5895,"Moreover , banks were forced to borrow a huge 5 . 2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated ."
5896,"However , economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week ."
5897,They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week .
5898,"First , economists now expect M - 1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs , partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes ."
5899,"As banks ' checking - account liabilities rise , so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed ."
5900,"Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2 . 5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday , but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M - 1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late ."
5901,"Second , an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed , economists said ."
5902,"Thus , although there were 10 . 3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night , the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so ."
5903,""" It ' s not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn ' t add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral ,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc . McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount - window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day , equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6 - 3 / 8 pct ."
5904,"After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data , economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy ."
5905,Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy .
5906,"But after reviewing today ' s figures , he said , "" It ' s fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture ."""
5907,Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6 - 1 / 4 and 6 - 3 / 8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar ' s fall gathers pace .
5908,"Johnson at First Chicago agreed , citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar - defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the U . S . trade surplus with Japan ."

6063,PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX Philippine Coconut Authority ( PCA ) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community ( EC ) levy on vegetable oil imports .
6064,""" I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines ,"" Romero said in an interview ."
6065,He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position .
6066,"Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany , the Netherlands , Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax ."
6067,"But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides , and if that happened opposition could crumble ."
6068,"Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin , a carcinogenic chemical ."
6069,"He said the EC standard of 0 . 02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal , which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988 , was too rigid ."
6070,He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin .
6071,Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground .
6072,Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards .
6073,"It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally , but this was likely to take several years of research ."
6074,"Copra meal exports were 817 , 641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986 ."
6075,The meal was worth 73 . 5 mln dlrs .
6076,Romero said he would also visit Oxford University ' s department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether .
6077,""" There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra ,"" Romero said ."
6078,""" We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun ."
6079,"Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non - food products , or we can go to the chemical root ."""
6080,He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop .
6081,""" In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production , and I ' m not comfortable with that ,"" he said ."
6082,"With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil , a coconut oil substitute , palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 , Romero said ."
6083,""" To add to that the U . S ."
6084,"Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart ,"" he said ."
6085,Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year .
6086,"They would probably touch a high of 20 cents / pound from the current level of 18 . 59 cents , and a sharp rise from year - ago levels of 10 . 50 cents ."
6087,Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five - year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests .
6088,"He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year , to add to the production fall , drought had affected output ."
6089,""" Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again ."
6090,"The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing , adding more value ,"" he said ."
6091,"Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees , he said ."
6092,""" A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10 , 000 square metres of land ."
6093,"That ' s a lot of space ,"" Romero said ."
6094,He said the government ' s proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven - hectares of land .
6095,""" If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels , production and employment then it won ' t happen ,"" he said ."
6096,PCA figures show about one - third of the country ' s population is dependent on the coconut industry .

6098,"PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year , but OPEC ' s decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor , an official of Mexico ' s state oil company , Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ), told a group of Japanese businessmen ."
6099,"Adrian Lajous , Pemex ' executive vice president of international trade , said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16 . 6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter ."
6100,""" Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned , while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago ,"" he said ."
6101,"He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price , and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels ."
6102,The 13 - member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output .
6103,""" I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions ,"" Lajous said ."
6104,"A repetition of what happened last year , when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs , is always there as a possibility , he said ."
6105,""" I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986 ."
6106,"I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained ,"" he said ."
6107,"Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets , but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control ."
6108,"He said Saudi King Fahd ' s remarks last month , that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output , were "" very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer ."""

6424,"The sources , who asked not to be named , said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field ' s operator through the development phase , with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s ."
6425,Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved .
6426,"It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday ' s cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies , the sources added ."
6427,"This spring Norway ' s state - owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that , if approved by the government , would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator , a move sharply criticised by Conoco ."

6430,"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect , although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves ."
6431,"Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank , encouraged by a strong guilder / mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German , might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first ."
6432,"Last month , the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5 . 1 pct from 5 . 25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3 . 55 pct from 3 . 8 pct ."
6433,"That rate has remained in force , just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings ."
6434,"Given a strong guilder , a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff , forcing an official Dutch rate cut , analysts said ."
6435,"In February , when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3 . 5 pct , the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota ."
6436,"Since then , however , both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates ."
6437,"In April , Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut , and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2 . 25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100 . 10 pct for an effective yield of 5 . 98 pct , the lowest since 1965 ."
6438,"Technically , analysts said , there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota , and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market ."
6439,"Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate , provided the guilder / mark relationship permitted ."
6440,The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112 . 673 guilders per 100 marks .
6441,"Today , foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112 . 705 guilders per 100 at the fix , a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands , dealers said ."
6442,An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term .
6443,"However , he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term ."
6444,"In the Netherlands , the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil , or even negative , while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth ."
6445,""" It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation ,"" the ABN economist said ."
6446,"He said Dutch money supply growth , which ran at 3 . 4 pct in January , could also contribute to some inflation ."
6447,"At Amro Bank , a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year ."
6448,"The bank expects Dutch capital market rates , currently averaging around 6 . 1 pct , to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5 . 6 pct ."
6449,"Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down , probably only temporarily , while money rates could fall below five pct ."
6450,"Currently , all periods are traded at 5 . 12 to 5 . 25 pct in the money market ."

6576,"The agreement took industry analysts by surprise , largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals ."
6577,"Also , Dallas - based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982 , when , as Wyly Corp , it lost 7 . 7 mln dlrs , or 56 cts a share ."
6578,"At that time , Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses , only three of which were involved in computer software ."

6580,Computer Associates ' Wang and Uccel ' s Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products .
6581,"In addition to system utilities , Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers , while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market , where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems ."
6582,"Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies ' product lines , but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings ."
6583,He said about 20 pct of the companies ' products overlap .
6584,Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct .
6585,But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates ' earnings for the current fiscal year .
6586,Quinn of E . F . Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution .
6587,"Therefore , he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1 . 05 dlrs a share ."
6588,"Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales , marketing and research and development ."
6589,Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel .
6590,"Based on Friday ' s closing price , the company will swap 47 . 50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share , which is nearly 33 times Uccel ' s 1987 estimated earnings of 1 . 45 dlrs a share ."
6591,Stephen T . McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per - share earnings .
6592,But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base .
6593,"Wang said Haefner , the Swiss investor , would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger ."
6594,He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel .
6595,The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct .
6596,"In addition , he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U . S . Justice Department ."
6597,"Uccel ' s Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger , but he did not rule out working together with Wang ."

6614,COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases .
6615,One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows .
6616,"So far , only 21 , 000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this , traders noted , only on an intermittent basis ."
6617,"They noted the purchases , of 8 , 000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13 , 000 in the second , are well short of the limitations of no more than 5 , 000 tonnes in one day and 20 , 000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him ."
6618,"The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far , noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers ."
6619,"London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10 - day average indicator to its 1 , 935 sdr per tonne midway point ( or reference price )."
6620,"However , little progress has been made in that direction , and the 10 - day average is still well below the 1 , 600 sdr lower intervention level at 1 , 562 . 87 from 1 , 569 . 46 previously ."
6621,"The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow , although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic , traders said ."
6622,"Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers , they observed ."
6623,A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities .
6624,"In London , traders expressed surprise that no more than 21 , 000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150 , 000 tonnes ."

6631,"LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS The elimination of limits on daily price fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange , COMEX , appears to be having little effect on the market , analysts said ."
6632,""" There is nothing apparent from the change ,"" said William O ' Neill , director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc . "" The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet , in narrow ranges ,"" he said ."
6633,"On May 5 , COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold , silver , copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations , which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April ."
6634,"COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits , effective today ."
6635,"Gold futures , which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per ounce in most back months , were about 7 . 00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions , traders said ."
6636,"Silver futures , previously limited at 50 cents in most back months , were trading about 30 - 40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today ."
6637,"During the last week of April , silver futures often traded at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation , the dollar , and other factors ."
6638,"Traders rushed into the spot , or unlimited , contract to offset those moves , analysts said ."
6639,"As a result , O ' Neill said , there was much confusion , many unmatched trades , and large losses for some traders ."
6640,"The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100 , 000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner ."
6641,"Paul Cain , a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers , said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets ."

6661,TIN TRADERS ' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar - based tin futures market due to be launched in October .
6662,"Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current "" free market "" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange , LME , tin trading ceased in October 1985 ."
6663,Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries .
6664,"There is also a view among European traders that , while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point , a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable ."
6665,"Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange , but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved ."
6666,"Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4 , 200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam ."
6667,"Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3 , 400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4 , 680 stg in December 1986 ."
6668,"This compares with 8 , 140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10 , 350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year ."
6669,"LME warehouse stocks are now near a two - year low at 28 , 065 tonnes , having fallen steadily from a record high of 72 , 485 tonnes reached in February 1986 ."
6670,"Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply / demand deficit of some 28 , 000 / 29 , 000 tonnes ."
6671,"Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5 , 000 stg per tonne during 1987 ."
6672,"However , the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4 , 100 stg last month after approaching 4 , 700 stg in December ."
6673,The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers .
6674,There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year .
6675,"Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks ' original tin holdings of nearly 45 , 000 tonnes have now been almost halved , and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal ."
6676,"Some 80 , 000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council ' s , ITC , buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement ."
6677,"The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers , which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC - related holdings and halved its overall tin position ."
6678,"Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations , unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter ."
6679,"The Association of Tin Producing Countries , ATPC , has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella , but to date Brazil and China , two major producers , remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres , dealers said ."

6934,"Analysts said Entertainment Marketing , whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986 , may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics , the nation ' s biggest , at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged ."
6935,"The analysts questioned whether Houston - based Entertainment Marketing , founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors , had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns ."
6936,""" I have mixed feelings ,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler , Geurin and Turner , a Dallas brokerage ."
6937,""" On the one hand it ' s probably a cheap price ."
6938,"On the other hand , does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave ?"""
6939,""" It ' s a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing ,"" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson , a Minneapolis brokerage ."
6940,""" Electronics retailing is very management concentrated ; they ' d want to keep Crazy Eddie ' s management in place ."""
6941,"Laurence said that , since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4 . 3 percent of Crazy Eddie ' s 31 . 3 million shares , it may be trying to get the Antar - Belzberg group to increase its 7 - dlr - a - share offer ."

6945,He would not comment on the new offer .
6946,"Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other , often discounted electronics goods to retailers , primarily in the southwest , and directly to consumers by cable television ."

6978,"Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington , the largest u . s . textile maker ."
6979,"Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens , a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman ."
6980,Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow .

6982,"Burlington had previously agreed to a 2 . 44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc & lt ; MS >, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week ."
6983,Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer .
6984,Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt .
6985,"That information , Burlington said , was provided by James Ammeen , a former Burlington executive , through PaineWebber Group Inc & lt ; PWJ >."
6986,"Ammeen , who had worked for Burlington for 23 years , had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington ' s sales reporting to him ."

6991,Burlington lawyers claim Dominion ' s board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February .
6992,Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens .
6993,But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information .
6994,Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton .
6995,""" The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit , but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company ,"" said burlington lawyer Humphrey ."
6996,"Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington , as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States , would be in violation of anti - trust laws if it acquired Dominion , Canada ' s largest textile maker ."
6997,"Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia , which would reduce competition in the denim market , the lawyers said ."

7118,"Concerned by the first quarter downturn , the U . S . Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports , either through fiscal or monetary policy ."
7119,"Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions , just as occured in 1986 ."
7120,Year - on - year growth was thus about two pct .
7121,He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct .
7122,""" It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly ,"" he said , noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample ."
7123,"Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year - on - year pace of 7 - 1 / 2 to eight pct , well above the Bundesbank ' s three to six pct target ."
7124,He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long - term capital flows .
7125,"Heavy inflows , particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation , boosted domestic money supply ."
7126,""" There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed ,"" Schlesinger said ."
7127,A major reason for the inflows was the market ' s conviction that the mark was headed higher .
7128,""" As we can see from the market , expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished ,"" Schlesinger said ."
7129,"The recent widening of interest rate differentials , the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar , he said ."
7130,"Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise , as the U . S . Did in March when the dollar rose above 1 . 87 marks , he said this would depend on the circumstances ."
7131,"At midday here , the dollar stood at 1 . 8340 / 45 marks ."
7132,""" Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react ,"" Schelsinger said ."
7133,""" One has to look at how it ( the market ) is moving ,"" he said , adding , "" It is not only our own case , it is also the American case ."""
7134,He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar ' s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now .
7135,""" But it wouldn ' t be good to have short - term fluctuations ,"" he said ."
7136,""" Let us wait and see ."""
7137,""" It is mainly the strength of the ( dollar ) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock , than the level ( of rates ) as such ,"" Schlesinger said ."
7138,"The sharp rise of the mark , coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil , had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year ."
7139,"Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up , he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices ."
7140,"The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged , at about one to 1 - 1 / 2 pct , he said ."
7141,"Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term , in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation ."
7142,"The above - target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves , a matter which might be taken up at the mid - year meeting of the Bundesbank ' s council , Schlesigner said ."
7143,"But he added : "" I don ' t see any great pressure to go away from it ."""
7144,"JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS Deregulation of Japan ' s oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups , industry sources said ."
7145,"They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council , an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI )."
7146,"A spokesman for a major firm said , "" Deregulation would bring about a reorganization ."
7147,"If it ' s a by - product of freer competition , we have no choice but to accept it ."""
7148,The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12 .
7149,The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year - old protection of the industry .
7150,"It should cut capacity to 3 . 8 mln barrels per day , about 75 pct of current capacity ."
7151,"Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output , and oil tariffs should be abolished ."
7152,"They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency , and most saw it as inevitable ."
7153,""" Deregulation is taking place everywhere ."
7154,"Now it ' s our turn to see if we can survive cut - throat competition ,"" said a source at one major Japanese oil company ."
7155,"A spokesman for a smaller refiner said , "" We ' ll have a hard time surviving , but that ' s something we must go through ."""
7156,""" In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division , we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies ,"" he said ."
7157,Larger companies are also streamlining .
7158,"Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985 , cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986 ."
7159,"Cosmo Oil Co Ltd , the third largest seller of oil products in 1985 , cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year , a spokesman for the company said ."
7160,"Between 1984 and 1986 , on the recommendation of the Council , 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry ."
7161,Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups .
7162,""" MITI means business ."
7163,"It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles ,"" a source said ."
7164,A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls .
7165,He declined to officially confirm or deny that the Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards deregulation .

7185,The National Economic Development Authority ( NEDA ) announced yesterday gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew 5 . 78 pct and gross national product ( GNP ) 5 . 53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier .
7186,""" I don ' t see anything on the horizon that should cut it ( growth ) short ,"" Fernandez said ."
7187,NEDA said GNP had grown 3 . 56 pct and GDP 3 . 25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier .
7188,"Last year ' s GNP growth , put earlier at 0 . 13 pct , was revised to 1 . 51 pct ."
7189,""" Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block ,"" Fernandez said ."
7190,""" I think even before the figures came out , simply looking at key indicators , such as consumption of fuel oil and power , showed that the economy was on a different track from last year ,"" he said ."
7191,"Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather , and it could drop off in the third quarter ."
7192,"He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector , which grew by 9 . 64 pct , after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986 ."
7193,""" That is not a seasonal thing , it is secular ,"" he said ."
7194,He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ).
7195,It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand - by arrangement soon .
7196,"The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23 , 1988 ."
7197,Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January - June period .
7198,He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1 . 56 billion dlrs over the 1987 - 92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs .
7199,Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years .
7200,""" It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA ( official development assistance ) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line ,"" he said ."
7201,"It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled , Fernandez said ."
7202,The Philippines rescheduled 10 . 3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March .
7203,"Fernandez said Central Bank bills , introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity , had peaked at 43 . 1 billion pesos in April 1986 ."
7204,"But their unwinding on maturity dates , started in October last year , had almost been completed ."
7205,"He said auctions of treasury bills , whose outstanding level touched 95 . 44 billion pesos on May 20 , were going well ."
7206,""" Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool ,"" he said ."
7207,"Commenting on the country ' s foreign debt Fernandez said , "" I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable ."""
7208,The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29 . 04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987 .
7209,"NEDA said exports totalled 1 . 2 billion dlrs in the first quarter , while imports were 1 . 4 billion dlrs ."
7210,Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6 . 5 pct this year .
7211,He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved .
7212,"Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso , currently pegged at 20 . 50 to the dollar , ought to be devalued to make the country ' s exports more competitive ."
7213,""" By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country ' s trading partners ,"" he said ."
7214,"On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code , he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code ."
7215,"The imposition of the Code , scheduled for last January , has been delayed by objections from some business groups ."
7216,""" I think any central bank , certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years , has to be prudent ."
7217,"This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I ' m not about to do that ,"" Fernandez said ."
7218,""" It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free ,"" he said ."

7273,"POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators , for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world ' s financial destiny for the last seven years , and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark ."
7274,"President of the powerful and independent West German central bank , the Bundesbank , Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year , government officials say ."
7275,"( Index of economic spotlights , see page ECRA ) But no official announcement has yet been made , raising eyebrows in West Germany ' s business community ."
7276,"The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats , now in opposition , before he moved to the Bundesbank ."
7277,There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats .
7278,But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl ' s government took office in 1982 .
7279,"Poehl , the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States , enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up ."
7280,"Given these circumstances , Kohl will probably overlook Poehl ' s past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt , and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister , bankers said ."
7281,"It was Schmidt who , as Chancellor , appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980 ."
7282,"In recent months , with the mark ' s strong rise against the dollar , Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank ' s council , a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold ."
7283,Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century .
7284,"But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986 , and inflation negligible so far this year , Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate ."
7285,""" I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar / mark rate have reached a high priority , also for the Bundesbank , because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany ,"" he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently ."
7286,"Ute Geipel , head of research at Citibank AG , says that Poehl ' s reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy ."
7287,""" Poehl ' s policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors , but also on the external economy ,"" she said ."
7288,"An economist at a German bank , who declined to be identified , said "" If Poehl is confirmed in his post , it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply ."""
7289,"One of Poehl ' s great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop "" talking down "" the dollar ."
7290,"For Poehl , the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies ."
7291,The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test .
7292,But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact .
7293,""" This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don ' t know - what the central banks can do ,"" Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round , making a speculator ' s position worthless ."
7294,Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career .
7295,"A relaxed sun - tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer , he is hardly a stereotype central banker ."
7296,He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf .
7297,Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced .
7298,""" But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment ,"" he said ."
7299,Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled .
7300,""" They ' ve burnt the fingers of many people ,"" he said ."

7494,"Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome , they said ."
7495,"But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if U . K . Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party ' s lead slipping , they added ."

7499,""" We have been playing a very full part ourselves ,"" he said ."
7500,"But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling , and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise , more in the light of local factors ."
7501,"Steven Bell , chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities , said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government , after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out ."
7502,U . K .
7503,"Portfolio investment is also returning , while foreign buyers see U . K . Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive ."
7504,"They will be strong buyers of U . K . Assets , notably equities , once the election is out of the way , Bell said ."
7505,"Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates , as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound ."
7506,"Today , however , the pound hardly moved on the reserves news , dipping on its trade - weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73 . 1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73 . 0 pct at 1100 GMT , half an hour after the figures were released ."
7507,""" The market doesn ' t want to do anything because of the election ,"" commented an economist at a big U . S . Investment bank ."
7508,Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market .
7509,"The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound ' s sudden downturn , while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April , they said ."
7510,"The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1 / 8 point , reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U . K . Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news , analysts said ."
7511,"Government bond prices initially firmed , but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves , they added ."
7512,"Morgan Grenfell ' s Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election , so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate , with another half point later ."
7513,"Justin Silverton , equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore , said a full point reduction might be possible ."
7514,""" Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future , rather than this active intervention ,"" he predicted ."
7515,"Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt - Edged cautioned against over - optimistic forecasts , but agreed a half point cut looked likely ."
7516,A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out .
7517,""" The Bank ( of England ) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money ( growth ),"" said Robin Marshall , chief U . K ."

7528,"S . AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation ' s flagging economic growth rate , economic analysts said ."
7529,"Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education , Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government ' s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament , the analysts said ."
7530,"Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1 , while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes ."
7531,""" Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary , but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation ,"" said Rob Lee , chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co . South Africa this year is targeting inflation - adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct ."
7532,"Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1 . 5 pct , while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct ."
7533,"Economists estimate that the government ' s spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand , with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand ."
7534,"This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand , or four pct of GDP ."
7535,"The government , having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade , also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget , analysts said ."
7536,""" The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure ,"" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview ."
7537,Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets .
7538,"South African Mutual ' s Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year , leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5 . 5 pct of GDP , compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF ."
7539,""" The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned ,"" predicted one analyst , noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years ."
7540,The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985 .
7541,"Against a background of Western economic sanctions , falling per capita incomes , rising joblessness and high inflation , government officials say economic growth is the prime objective ."
7542,But private - sector economists caution that the government ' s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country ' s balance of payments .
7543,"Most of that surplus , this year estimated at around 2 . 5 billion dlrs , will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation ' s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks ."
7544,"Within these constraints , economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre ."
7545,Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state - owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely .
7546,Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini - budget before the May 6 whites - only election .
7547,The poll delayed presentation of the national budget .

7567,"Pointing to the record 4 . 8 billion stg rise in U . K . May currency reserves announced today he said , "" we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto ."""

7598,"ETL said today it would offer 4 . 15 dlrs each for Monier ' s issued capital of 156 . 28 mln shares , plus a share alternative ."
7599,This compares with a 3 . 80 dlr cash element in CSR ' s proposed bid .
7600,"The proposed offer by ETL , controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins , came after it built up a 14 . 99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days ."
7601,"Herbert said Britain ' s Redland Plc & lt ; RDLD . L >, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier , still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller ."
7602,"He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U . S ., Where Monier has built up a strong presence , notably in roofing tile manufacture ."
7603,The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland .
7604,This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50 . 1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR .
7605,CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option .

7610,"Asked what he thought ETL ' s bid sought to achieve , Herbert said : "" I ' m puzzled as to what Hawkins ' strategy is ."
7611,"One has to wonder if Monier is the main target ."""
7612,"Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid , and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals ."

7615,Its bid is subject to FIRB approval .
7616,"Herbert also said that institutions , which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash , would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares ."
7617,ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year .
7618,Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price .

7678,"May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and mixed food , turkey , seafood , pork , eggs and other foods ."
7679,May said the chicken industry favored moving away from bird - by - bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination of poultry .
7680,"However , Ellen Haas , executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy , said bird - by - bird inspection should be retained and labels should be attached to each ready - to - cook chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness ."
7681,Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards .
7682,U . S . HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS The House Agriculture Committee voted to make approximately 2 . 8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency payments immediately instead of in the late fall .

7749,ALLEGIS & lt ; AEG > TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS Allegis Corp said it has created a limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the public .
7750,It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350 mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of September .
7751,The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago .
7752,Allegis reported a pretax gain of 80 . 6 mln dlrs as a result of that partnership .
7753,An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent corporate developments such as the firm ' s recapitalization plan and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit .
7754,The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale .
7755,"Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in Vancouver , Calgary , Ottawa and Toronto , and 100 pct interest in Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal ."

7769,"Lukman , who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials , said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non - OPEC oil producers , Swedish government officials said ."
7770,"They said Lukman , who is also Nigerian oil minister , made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations ."
7771,"Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world ' s industrial nations , Lukman said ."
7772,"Although very low oil prices , such as those seen around the beginning of the year , may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy , they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term , he said ."

7775,"BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit , banking economists and money market dealers said ."
7776,"The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts , and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future , they said ."
7777,"The council will meet in Saarbruecken , and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT ."
7778,"But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt , and did not necessarily herald any policy moves ."
7779,Bundesbank Vice - President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark .
7780,"Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo , where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office , that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1 / 2 to one pct in the first quarter ."
7781,"Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3 . 50 / 70 pct range for most of this month , after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3 . 50 pct , allocating funds at 3 . 55 pct ."
7782,""" They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further , but not with the discount or Lombard ,"" Winfried Hutmann , chief economist of Schroeder , Munchmeyer , Hengst Investment GmbH said ."
7783,"Werner Chrobok , managing partner at Bethmann Bank , said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany ."
7784,"A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand , with companies swimming in liquidity , Chrobok said ."
7785,"The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates , when this would be better held in reserve ."
7786,""" The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder ,"" he said ."
7787,"A cut in the discount or Lombard rates , to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month , would have little practical significance , dealers said ."
7788,The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week ' s Venice summit .
7789,"But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "" eyewash ."""
7790,"Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes , rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy , to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit ."
7791,"But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit , it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further ."
7792,""" The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can ' t risk increasing the deficit further ,"" said Schroeder , Muenchmeyer , Hengst ' s Hutmann ."
7793,"Bethmann ' s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice , it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy ."
7794,""" But I don ' t expect any convincing measures ,"" he said ."
7795,"Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today , falling to 3 . 60 / 70 pct from 3 . 75 / 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month - end distortions ."
7796,"Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers , starting in the week beginning June 15 ."
7797,Two public holidays that week could also distort the market .
7798,"Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3 . 55 pct , after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3 . 50 pct , and to fully replace the 5 . 5 billion marks in an outgoing pact ."
7799,But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3 . 6 pct rather than 3 . 55 .
7800,"That would not represent a tightening of policy , however ."
7801,"Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate , some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3 . 6 pct , dealers said ."
7802,"On another issue , Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ( ECU ) at one of its meetings soon ."
7803,"Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity , as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France , and was twice under French occupation this century ."
7804,"But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week , as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved , for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes ."
7805,"ALCAN REDUCES COST OF PLANNED SMELTER Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it has cut the expected cost of its planned Laterriere , Quebec , smelter by using enhanced Grande Baie reduction technology ."
7806,"The company said the decision to use prebaked anode technolgy used at its Grande Baie , Quebec , and Sebree , Ky ., smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons ."
7807,"As a result , it said , the estimated total cost of the planned smelter will be held to 450 mln U . S . dlrs , the low end of the range estimated in mid - May , while the cost of the first phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175 - 225 mln dlrs ."
7808,"GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS The West German government ' s independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate , government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said ."
7809,A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1 - 1 / 2 to two pct was achievable .
7810,"It added the council believed "" an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for ."""
7811,Ost ' s statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase .
7812,"The government regularly uses the term "" changed external economic factors "" when referring to the fall of the dollar , which has severely damaged West German exports ."
7813,"Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year , but could still fall below the 1986 level ."
7814,"Along with other leading industrial countries , West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar ."
7815,"The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week ' s seven nation summit in Venice , where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U . S . And other partners to boost its economy ."
7816,West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget .
7817,The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low .
7818,The experts ' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1 - 1 / 2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast .
7819,Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports .

7945,They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides .
7946,They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) auspices .

7949,Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports .
7950,The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports .
7951,""" We can ' t believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries , but such would be the impact of these measures ,"" Wilson said ."

7954,"Wilson , who was chairing the news conference , made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats ."

8373,""" Disappointment of European central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower ,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff ."

8728,The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1 . 4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House .
8729,"The negotiators also agreed to cut 1 . 6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2 . 45 billion in 1990 , for a total of 5 . 3 billion in saving over three years , sources said ."
8730,"The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments , senior Congressional aides told Reuters ."
8731,Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings .
8732,"Rep . Dan Glickman , D - Kan ., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee , has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2 . 28 dlrs and 1 . 92 dlrs respectively , saying it would save 500 mln dlrs ."
8733,House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal .
8734,"But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng , who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims ."
8735,"Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program , ARP , levels for wheat and corn ."
8736,"However , on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration , arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27 . 5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget , OMB ."
8737,Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail .
8738,Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP .
8739,But one informed Congressional source said singling - out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity .
8740,"Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules , and possible adoption of a 0 / 92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains ."
8741,"Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1 . 25 billion but not enough , they said ."
8742,"Ultimately , Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across - the - board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp . payments to farmers , including price support loans and deficiency payments , similar to the Gramm - Rudman - Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986 ."
8743,"This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation , AFBF , as the fairest approach for all commodities ."

8748,"They said Nigeria , which holds the OPEC conference presidency , and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive ."
8749,"There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high - sulphur heavy crudes , to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices ."
8750,"But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely , so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC ' s new unity ."
8751,""" All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials ,"" said one analyst with a major oil company ."
8752,""" But at the end of the day , the attitude is going to be "" leave well alone ' and little or nothing is likely to be altered ."""
8753,"Iran , Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year , traders say ."
8754,"But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and , in some cases , marketing incentives have helped their sales ."
8755,"Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts , processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a "" package ."""
8756,"Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced , at least for some part of the year ."
8757,But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil - rich heavy crudes and gasoline - rich lighter grades .
8758,"At its last meeting in December , OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point ."
8759,Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers .
8760,OPEC also decided to limit first - half 1987 output to 15 . 8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16 . 6 mln for the third quarter and 18 . 3 mln for the fourth .
8761,Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months .
8762,"Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices , but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials , analysts say ."
8763,The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non - OPEC crudes .
8764,"OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes , with a 2 . 65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest ."
8765,Extra heavy crudes were among those left out .
8766,Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices .
8767,"Several experts say only one - quarter to one - third of the total in fact sells at official prices , with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products ."
8768,"Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year , when some producers ' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices ."
8769,Nigeria especially found its gasoline - rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC ' s highest priced grade at 18 . 92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain ' s Brent .
8770,"In February and March , Nigeria ' s production shrank below its 1 . 238 mln bpd OPEC quota ."
8771,"Spot prices have since revived , due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline , and its output has risen ."
8772,Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel .
8773,"But Mehdi Varzi , chief oil analyst with London ' s Kleinwort Grieveson Securities , doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna ."
8774,""" It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria , which holds the presidency , raised the issue ,"" he said ."
8775,NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE Analysts said they were surprised at the government ' s announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy .
8776,Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1 . 95 billion deficit last year .
8777,Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts ' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets .
8778,Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2 . 3 billion dlr deficit .
8779,But none predicted a surplus .
8780,"The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets , one analyst said ."
8781,"Paradoxically , the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term , despite lower interest rates , as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand , he said ."
8782,"However , some foreign exchange dealers disagreed , saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower ."
8783,"The local dollar dropped to 0 . 5940 / 50 U . S . Dlrs in after hours trading , against 0 . 5970 / 77 just before the budget release ."
8784,"Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market , despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures ."
8785,One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow .
8786,"The Budget statement was broadly as expected , with a continuation of existing policies , and the absence of traditional pre - election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors , another said ."
8787,"But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti - tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market , particularly multi - national companies ."
8788,"The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements , through bond tenders , as a result of the surplus ."
8789,The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N . Z .

8871,A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates .
8872,"News that underlying earnings are rising 7 . 75 pct annually , taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth , revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit , they said ."

8876,"It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post - general election cut was imminent , supported by such optimistic economic news as May ' s record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling ' s strength ."
8877,"The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May ' s 64 , 300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate , to 2 . 95 mln or 10 . 6 pct of the workforce , was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April , dealers said ."

8985,"EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats , saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax ."
8986,"Norbert Tanghe , head of division of the Commission ' s Directorate General for Agriculture , told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days "" the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy ."""
8987,"The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable , Tanghe said ."
8988,"Recent estimates put these costs at 4 . 0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2 . 0 billion Ecus , he said ."
8989,"In 1990 the Community ' s "" standstill "" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement ."
8990,"The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system , he added ."
8991,"Under the Commission ' s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector , a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced , Tanghe said ."
8992,Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level .
8993,He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy ' s oils and fats regime .
8994,""" The Commission believes that hostile reactions ( to the proposed tax ) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal ,"" he said ."
8995,"Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , GATT , rules ."
8996,"It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products , and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats ."
8997,"EC - produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements , he said ."
8998,"The competitiveness between different oils , whether EC produced or imported , would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax , Tanghe said ."
8999,"The proposed system would not alter the EC nations ' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand , he said ."
9000,"It is one of the proposal ' s objectives to maintain current import levels , he said ."
9001,"Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC ' s cakes and meals requirements , which are not covered by the stabilising system ."

9116,The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue .
9117,"Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers , pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September ."
9118,"When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas , they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment , known in GATT jargon as "" standstill and rollback ."""
9119,"Tran criticised Washington for the "" superfund "" tax on oil imports , a customs user fee , and the removal of a special machine tool ( known as category FSC34 ) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security ."
9120,"Warren Lavorel , a U . S . Trade official , defended the policies , saying they did not violate GATT trade rules ."

9133,"ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT Zambia ' s copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500 , 000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices , deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs , industry officials said ."
9134,"But Zambia ' s decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability , they said ."
9135,"Copper production by the government - controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines ( ZCCM ) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471 , 000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463 , 354 tonnes ."
9136,""" We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year , copper production could well be over 500 , 000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment ,"" a ZCCM official said ."
9137,"ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt , another strategic income earner , will also be tailored to meet demand ."
9138,"Finished production in 1986 was 4 , 565 tonnes , 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date ."
9139,"Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia , the world ' s fifth biggest producer ."
9140,Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country ' s foreign exchange earnings .
9141,"Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns , deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts , fuel and lubricants ."
9142,"The 463 , 354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700 , 000 tonnes ."
9143,"A five - year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community , the African Development Bank and the World Bank ."
9144,The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable .
9145,"ZCCM , the second largest employer after the government , has said it intends to lay off 20 , 000 of its 60 , 000 workforce as part of the plan ."
9146,More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five - year restructuring plan .
9147,"Company officials said although reserves were being depleted , Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century , though at lower levels of production ."
9148,Industry sources said ZCCM ' s projected pre - tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha .
9149,"But with the current mineral export tax level being levied , a net loss is likely to be registered ."
9150,ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before .
9151,"Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985 , ZCCM ' s profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar ."
9152,"But on May 1 , President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system , inspired by the International Monetary Fund , and announced Zambia would pursue a go - it - alone economic strategy based on national resources ."
9153,ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry ' s plans .
9154,""" We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation ,"" Peter Hansen , director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy , told Reuters ."
9155,Some analysts believe the new officially - fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM ' s export profits .
9156,""" Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break - even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar ,"" Frederick Chiluba , leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said ."
9157,High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry .
9158,"Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound , compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile ."

9277,"BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U . S . CONSUMER SPENDING A trade - led boom in the U . S . is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy , Bank of America said in its latest economic report ."
9278,"Although net exports will add 0 . 7 pct to GNP this year , after reducing it by 1 . 2 pct in 1986 , consumer spending will contribute 1 . 4 pct less to GNP than it did last year ."
9279,"As a result , GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2 . 5 pct , the same rate as last year , according to Daniel Van Dyke , the Bank of America economist who wrote the report ."
9280,""" Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income ,"" Van Dyke said ."
9281,"Growth in U . S . consumer spending is likely to slow to 1 . 8 pct this year from 4 . 1 pct in 1986 , he predicted ."
9282,"The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0 . 2 pct in May , after increasing 0 . 4 pct in April , and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0 . 1 pct , compared with a 0 . 6 pct increase the month before ."
9283,"The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3 . 7 pct this year , up from 1 . 9 pct in 1986 , Bank of America forecast ."
9284,This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1 . 3 pct in 1987 from 2 . 9 pct in 1986 .
9285,"As a result , Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1 , 210 dlrs during 1986 ."
9286,The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4 . 2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1 . 63 mln units .
9287,""" For the first time in several years , a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility ,"" Van Dyke said ."

9290,"BROOKLYN UNION & lt ; BU > SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE Brooklyn Union Gas Co , a New York gas utility , will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of Transco Energy Co ' s & lt ; E > decision to close its pipelines to transport spot gas sales , energy industry analysts said ."
9291,"Brooklyn Union , the fourth largest gas utility in the United States , purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot , or non - contract , market in 1986 , and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987 , analysts said ."
9292,"Texas Eastern pipelines & lt ; TET >, the other competing pipeline , to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South closed its gate station for summer , and Brooklyn Union has relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies ."
9293,"In the month of May , Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas , while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU , industry sources said ."
9294,Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take - or - pay liabilities .
9295,Take - or - pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers .
9296,"Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause , a Brooklyn Union official said ."
9297,"Foster Corwith , gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds , said most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through to rate payers ."
9298,"While net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings , end - users , especially residential and commercial customers , will end up paying more for gas , he said ."
9299,"Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low , the impact on cash flow would be small , Curt Launer , natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette , said ."
9300,"If the situation persists into winter heating season , high cost gas could cut in the company ' s profits , he said ."
9301,"Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for spot gas , such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co & lt ; NCNG >, Piedmont Natural Gas Co & lt ; PNY >, will face the same high cost factor as Brooklyn Union , Steve Richards , a supply manager with end users supply system , a Houston based natural gas brokering firm , said ."
9302,""" But these companies are not unwitting victims of the take - or - pay dispute between Transco and producers ,"" he said ."
9303,"Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco ' s request for an inventory charge , which reserves the pipeline facility for spot gas to be delivered to these companies , he said ."
9304,"Without spot supplies , the high cost of system gas will threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to alternative fuels , he said ."
9305,"In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , the matter is being negotiated between pipelines and customers , Richards said ."
9306,"Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas for them , these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory on the inventory charge , he said ."

9338,"GILLETTE & lt ; GS > SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR Ronald Perelman , head of Revlon Group Inc & lt ; REV >, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette Co that could draw some big international players and in the process make a lot of money for himself , Wall Street analysts said ."
9339,"Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting , Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40 . 50 dlrs per share ."
9340,Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission .
9341,""" I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money ,"" said Andrew Shore , analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . "" In play "" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target ."
9342,Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29 . 75 dlrs per share .
9343,"Gillette rose three to 40 today , following a gain of three yesterday ."
9344,"The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman ' s previous holding of 18 . 4 mln shares , adjusted for a split ."
9345,"For example , a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula ."
9346,Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment .
9347,""" Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette ,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co . "" I ' m not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share ."""
9348,Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette .
9349,"He said Perelman , in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago , probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon ' s operations ."
9350,""" He ' s trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business ."""
9351,Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions .
9352,"Under those circumstances , Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc & lt ; UN . AS > or Procter and Gamble Co & lt ; PG > decided to take a look at Gillette ."
9353,"Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith , Hanson Trust plc & lt ; HAN >, RJR Nabisco Inc & lt ; RJR >, American Brands Inc & lt ; AMB > and Ralston Purina Co & lt ; RAL >."
9354,""" Perelman is trying to put the company in play ,"" said a Wall Street arbitrageur ."
9355,""" He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold ."""
9356,Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman ' s overture .
9357,""" I can ' t see the board consenting , what has changed between November and now ,"" he said ."
9358,Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on .
9359,""" Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation ,"" he said ."

9400,"Present loan rates are 2 . 28 dlrs for wheat , 1 . 92 for corn , and effectively 4 . 56 for soybeans ."
9401,"Also under the plan , the U . S . would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations , to share - out export markets , Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs ."
9402,"Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his "" Family Farm Act ."""
9403,-- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture .
9404,"-- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U . S . agricultural exports as critics claim , but would increase overall revenue from exports ."
9405,This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices .
9406,"Sen . Christopher Bond , R - Mo ., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable ."
9407,"-- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers , but he said high food prices stem more from "" gouging "" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices ."
9408,"Harkin cited what he termed "" excessive "" net returns on equity over five years of 33 . 4 pct at Kellogg , 31 . 9 pct Monfort , 22 . 8 pct Nabisco , 22 . 8 pct ConAgra , 21 . 2 pct H . J ."
9409,"Heinz , 19 . 1 pct Ralston Purina , 17 . 2 pct Pillsbury and 16 . 7 pct Quaker Oats ."

9411,"He said as a transition to the higher prices , he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp . grain stocks for three years ."
9412,"Thereafter , livestock farmers would benefit from a "" predictable and stable "" grain price , he said ."

9422,"OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND West German economic growth will slow to 1 . 5 pct this year from 2 . 4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said in its semi - annual review of the world economy ."
9423,"This view is less favourable than the West German government ' s forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year , but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1 . 5 to two pct ."
9424,"The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year , with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms ."
9425,The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future .
9426,"But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand , which is only forecast to rise by 2 . 5 pct this year and 2 . 75 pct in 1988 , below 1986 ' s 3 . 7 pct ."
9427,"While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988 , the OECD said that "" the medium to longer - term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates ."""
9428,"Since the OECD report was compiled , the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0 . 5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986 ."

9433,"HIGHER GROWTH , UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE , OECD SAYS France ' s growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half , but unemployment will worsen , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said ."
9434,"In its semi - annual review of the world economy , the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) would run at about two pct in the next six months ."
9435,"It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends , but significantly higher than in the first half of this year ."
9436,The OECD said France ' s economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987 .
9437,"Activity has slowed , primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment , while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated , the OECD said ."
9438,Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988 .
9439,The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year .
9440,"But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986 , it added ."
9441,"The OECD forecast a 2 . 75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year , a one pct drop from the first six months ."
9442,"The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3 . 25 pct for the whole year , sharply up from last year ' s 2 . 2 pct ."

9445,"ITALIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK LESS BRIGHT , OECD SAYS Italy ' s economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth , higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said ."
9446,"But the OECD , in its half - yearly report , forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years ."
9447,Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD ' s fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth at 2 . 7 pct .
9448,"The OECD said Italy ' s GDP may grow by three pct in 1987 , but will then fall back to 2 . 5 pct in 1988 ."
9449,"The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices , particularly oil , an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure , the report said ."
9450,"This year , and to a lesser degree in 1988 , domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations ."
9451,"Domestic demand pressure , coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness , is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988 ."
9452,This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account .
9453,"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987 , OECD Japan ' s trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987 , as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said ."
9454,"In its latest half - yearly review of the world economy , the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year , when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct ."
9455,"But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 , "" thus weakening the international adjustment process ."""
9456,It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3 . 3 pct in 1987 and 3 . 6 pct in 1988 .
9457,"As a result , the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 , although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs ."
9458,"The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6 , 000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan ."
9459,"However , OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand , quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through , and thus will provide some stimulus to imports ."
9460,"The OECD outlook said , "" Continued large current account surpluses and the further build - up of an already - substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen ."""
9461,It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth .
9462,"The OECD said Japan ' s Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 , below 1986 ' s 2 . 5 pct growth ."
9463,"But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation , with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0 . 6 pct rise in consumer prices last year ."
9464,"U . S .- CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT U . S .- Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact , according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups ."
9465,The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries .
9466,"But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "" the two nations ' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement ."""
9467,"The United States and Canada , whose cross - border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year , have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries ."
9468,"The U . S . put a deadline on the talks of October 1 , but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained ."
9469,"Niskanen said if no pact is reached , bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively , and this could hit some Canadian trade practices ."
9470,"He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry , which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U . S . and Canadian autos and parts ."
9471,Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U . S . exports to Canada .
9472,"A free trade pact , backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale , which would also help it widen exports worldwide , he said ."
9473,It would also increase the gross national products of both countries .
9474,"Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years , lower subsidies on exports , set rules for trade in services and investments , end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes ."

9477,"Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1 . 5 to 2 . 0 pct , while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP ."
9478,"While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement , "" it will probably be insufficient to check the self - sustaining nature of the deficit ,"" the OECD said ."
9479,"In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1 . 5 pct this year and one pct in 1988 , with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising ."
9480,""" Employment is forecast to decelerate as well , reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts ,"" the report said ."
9481,"Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0 . 5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988 , partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices ."
9482,"Luxembourg ' s economy , by contrast , will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages ."
9483,But real growth in consumption will ease next year .
9484,"SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986 , though the growth is seen slowing this year and next , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said ."
9485,"In its semi - annual report , the OECD said Portugal ' s total domestic demand growth would decline from 7 . 6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3 . 75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption ."
9486,"Turkey ' s economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10 . 5 pct , but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year ."
9487,"In Spain , buoyant domestic demand , led by fixed investment , had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product ."
9488,Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong .
9489,"The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year , reflecting strong demand , entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness ."
9490,"In Greece , inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather ."
9491,"OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said ."
9492,"In Denmark , the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness ."
9493,Sweden ' s competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages .
9494,"The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark , as well as Norway , Sweden and Finland ."
9495,"Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988 , the OECD semi - annual report said ."
9496,"After a strong rise of 7 . 8 pct in 1986 , total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1 . 5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year ."
9497,Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand .
9498,"The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988 , while declining in Denmark and Norway ."

BUDGET DEFICIT The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit , including possible reductions in non - defense spending , higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said ."
9501,"The OECD , in its semi - annual review of the world economy , said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "" could seriously affect confidence , both in the United States and elsewhere ."""
9502,"It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987 , running until September 30 this year , would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act ' s target of 144 billion dlrs and official U . S ."

9504,""" The OECD projection , which is based on assumptions of slower growth , higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year , is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars ,"" it said ."
9505,"While this would be 30 billion lower than last year ' s deficit , much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect ."
9506,The U . S . Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2 . 75 pct next year from 2 . 5 pct this year and last .
9507,"In contrast to the last two years , more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth ."
9508,Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs .
9509,"But inflation appears to be heading higher , partly due to the lower dollar , with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4 . 5 pct next year after just 2 . 1 pct in 1986 ."

9521,"The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U . S ., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn ."

9524,"This was a clear reference to last February ' s Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada , analysts said ."
9525,"The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence , and called on more active fiscal policies from the U .

9526,"Henderson said the 6 , 000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process , though it was too early to estimate its precise impact ."

9552,""" We wouldn ' t have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe ,"" said Fildes ."
9553,He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market .
9554,Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business .
9555,Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms .

9569,But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system .

9912,LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES More U . K .
9913,Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates .
9914,"And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years , the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money ."
9915,"The decision to offer fixed rate loans , industry officials said , reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business ."
9916,"While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U . K ., They were the mainstay of the business in the U . S . Up until only a few years ago ."
9917,But in the early 1980s interest rates soared .
9918,U . S .
9919,"Lenders , mostly savings and loan associations , were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts ."
9920,As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge .
9921,The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds .
9922,""" We very much have the example of the U . S ."
9923,"Thrifts in mind ,"" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society , explaining why his institution , for the time being , is only offering variable rate mortgages ."
9924,The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more .
9925,"Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation ' s two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business , officials at all three institutions said ."
9926,The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans .
9927,""" Of course they are less profitable than other ( variable rate ) mortgages ,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc , which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans ."
9928,"But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because , "" It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product ."""
9929,Trustee Savings Bank Plc ( TSB ) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9 . 9 pct earlier this year .
9930,"The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days , according to a spokeswoman ."
9931,""" Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage ,"" she said , noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume ."
9932,"In short , the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates ."
9933,If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets .
9934,But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money .
9935,"Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further , according to Duncan Young , managing director ."
9936,Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument .
9937,But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being .
9938,He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably .
9939,"However , he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them ."
9940,This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor .
9941,For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages .
9942,"In the U . S ., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again , securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years ."
